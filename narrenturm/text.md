THE TOWER OF FOOLS
(Narrenturm)

***

The world did not perish and it did not burn.
At least, not all of it.
But it was still merry.
Especially for Reinmar of Bielawa, also known as Reynevan, an herbalist
and learned medic, related to many of the powerful figures of that world. This young man, having fallen in love with the beautiful and spirited wife of a Silesian
knight, experiences unforgettable moments of amorous passion.
Until, breaking down the door, the betrayed husband's kinsmen burst into the chamber.
And at that moment, things stop being merry for Reynevan.
Commenting on Reynevan's propensity for falling in love, Zawisza Czarny,
"the knight without flaw or stain," stated: "Oh, you won't die a natural death,
my boy!"
Zawisza, taken captive, was soon beheaded by the Turks.
And what of Reynevan?
Two more volumes of the trilogy lie before us.

***

The end of the world in the Year of Our Lord 1420 did not occur. Though much indicated
that it would.
The dark prophecies of the chiliasts, who foretold the coming of the End with considerable precision—namely, for the year 1420, the month of February, the Monday after Saint Scholastica's Day—did not come true. But well—Monday passed, Tuesday came, and after it Wednesday—and nothing. The Days of Punishment and Vengeance, preceding the advent of the Kingdom of God, did not arrive. Satan was not, though a thousand years had ended, released from his prison, nor did he go forth to deceive the nations from the four corners of the Earth. Not all the sinners of the world and enemies of God perished by the sword, fire, famine,
hail, by the fangs of beasts, by the stings of scorpions, and the venom of snakes. In vain did the faithful await
the coming of the Messiah on Mount Tabor, Baranek, Horeb, Zion, and Olivet; in vain
did the *quinque civitates*, the five chosen cities foretold
in Isaiah's prophecy—considered to be Pilsen, Klatovy, Louny, Slany, and Žatec—await the second coming of Christ. The end of the world did not occur. The world did not perish and it did not burn.
At least, not all of it.
But it was still merry.
Truly, this is an excellent pottage. Thick, spiced, and generously basted. I haven't eaten such in a long time. Thank you, worthy sirs, for the treat, and thank you too, little innkeeper-lass. Do I disdain beer, you ask? No. Rather not. If you permit, with pleasure. *Comedamus tandem, et bibamus, cras enim moriemur.*
There was no end of the world in 1420, nor a year later, nor two, nor three,
nor even four. Things ran, so to speak, their natural course.
Wars continued. Plagues multiplied, the *mors nigra* raged, hunger spread.
Neighbor killed and robbed neighbor, coveted his wife, and generally was a wolf to him.

From time to time, the Jews were treated to a little pogrom, and heretics to a little pyre. As for novelties
—skeletons danced in merry leaps
across cemeteries, Death with a scythe roamed the land, an incubus at night squeezed between the trembling thighs of sleeping
maidens,
a striga sat on the neck of a lone rider in a haunted place. The Devil visibly intervened in everyday affairs and circulated among people *tamquam leo rugiens*, like a roaring lion, seeking whom he might devour.
Many famous people died in those times. Ha, surely many were born too,
but it so happens that birth dates, by some strange chance, are not recorded in chronicles and for the life of them, no one remembers them, except
perhaps mothers and except
for those cases when a newborn had two heads or at least two pricks. But if a death, ha, then the date is certain, as if carved in stone.
Thus, in the year 1421, on the Monday after Laetare Sunday, having reached the meritorious age of sixty, Jan, styled Kropidło, a prince of
Piast blood and *episcopus Wloclaviensis*, died in Opole. Before his death, he had made a donation of six hundred *grzywna* to the city of Opole. They say that part of this sum, by the dying man's last will,
went to the famous Opole brothel "U Rudej Kundzi" (At the Red-Haired Floozy's). The bishop, a reveller,
frequented this establishment, located behind the Friars Minor monastery, until his very death—even if, towards the end of his life, only as an observer.
And in the summer—I don't recall the exact date—of the year 1422, King
Henry V of England, the victor of Agincourt, died in Vincennes. Surviving him by only two months,
the King of France, Charles VI, who had been completely mad for five years, died. The crown was claimed
by the madman's son, the Dauphin Charles. But the English did not recognize his rights. After all,
the Dauphin's own mother, Queen Isabeau, had long since declared him a bastard conceived
at some distance from the marital bed and with a man sound of mind.
And since bastards do not inherit the throne, the rightful ruler and monarch of France became an Englishman, Henry V's son, little Henry, only nine months old.
The regent in France became Henry's uncle, John Lancaster, Duke of Bedford. He,
together with the Burgundians, held northern France—including Paris—while the south
was held by the Dauphin Charles and the Armagnacs. And between their domains, dogs howled among the corpses on the battlefields.
And in the year 1423, on Whitsunday,
Peter de Luna, the Avignon Pope, an excommunicated schismatic, died in the castle of Peniscola near Valencia,
styling himself Benedict
XIII until his very death, contrary to the decrees of two councils.
Of others who died in those years and whom I remember, Ernest the Iron Habsburg, Duke of Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Istria, and Trieste, died. Jan of Racibórz,
a prince of both Piast and Przemyslid blood, died. Wenceslaus,
*dux Lubinensis*, died young; Duke Henryk, co-ruler with his brother Jan of Ziębice, died.
Henryk, *dictus* Rumpoldus, Duke of Głogów and *Landvogt* of Upper Lusatia, died abroad. Mikołaj Trąba,
Archbishop of Gniezno, a worthy and wise man, died.
4

Michael Küchmeister, Grand Master of the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary, died in Malbork. Jakub Pęczak, called Ryba (Fish), a miller from near Bytom, also died. Ha,
one must admit, a tad less famous and known than those mentioned above, but
with this advantage over them, that I knew him personally and even drank with him. With those
previously mentioned—somehow, it never happened.
Important events also took place in culture at that time. The inspired
Bernardine of Siena preached, Jan Kanty and Jan Kapistran preached, Jan Gerson and Paweł Włodkowic taught, Christine de Pisan and Thomas Hemerken à Kempis wrote learnedly. Wawrzyniec of Brzezowa wrote his very beautiful chronicle. Andrei
Rublev painted icons, Tommaso Masaccio painted, Robert Campin painted. Jan van Eyck, painter to King John of Bavaria, created the "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb" for Saint Bavo's Cathedral in Ghent,
a rather beautiful polyptych, now adorning the chapel of Jodocus Vyd. In Florence, Master Pippo Brunelleschi completed the construction of the marvelous dome over the four naves of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore. And we in
Silesia are no worse—here, Mr. Piotr of Frankenstein finished
the construction of a very grand church dedicated to Saint James in the city of Nysa. It's quite
close by, from Milicz, not far, whoever hasn't been and seen it, has the opportunity to be and see.
In that same year, 1422, during Shrovetide itself, in the town of Lida, with great pomp, the old Lithuanian, Polish King Jogajła, celebrated his wedding—he married Sonka Holszańska,
a blooming and very young maiden, seventeen years of age, thus more than half
a century younger than himself. As they said, this maiden was more famous for her beauty than her morals.
Well, there was much trouble from that later. And Jogajła, as if he had quite forgotten
how to enjoy a young wife, already by early summer marched against the Prussian lords,
that is, the Teutonic Knights. Thus, the new—after Küchmeister—
Grand Master of the Order, Sir Paul von Rusdorf, had to become acquainted with Polish arms—and harshly acquainted—almost immediately after taking office.
What happened in Sonka's bedchamber, it's futile to investigate, but to thrash the Teuton's arse,
Jogajła was still spry enough.
Many important things also took place in the Bohemian Kingdom in those
times. Great was the commotion there, great bloodshed and ceaseless war.
About which I can hardly speak, by the way... Forgive an old man, noble sirs, but
fear is a human thing, and one has already had to take it on the chin for a careless word. On your
jackets, sirs, I see Polish Nałęcz and Habdank coats of arms, and on yours,
noble Czechs, the roosters of the lords of Dobrá Voda and the arrows of the knights of Strakonice...
And you, man of Mars, you are surely a Zettritz, I judge by the aurochs head in your crest.
And yours, sir knight, I cannot even place your diagonal checks and griffins.
Nor can it be excluded that you, friar of the Order of Saint Francis,
do not report to the Holy Office, and that you, brothers of Saint Dominic, do report,
that is rather certain. Thus you yourselves see that I can hardly gossip about Bohemian affairs in such an international and diverse company, not knowing
who here is for Albrecht, and who for the Polish king and prince. Who here is for Menhart
5

of Hradec and Oldrzych of Rožmberk, and who for Hynek Ptáček of Pirkštejn
and Jan Kolda of Žampach. Who here is a supporter of Comes Spytko of Melsztyn, and who
a partisan of Bishop Oleśnicki. I have no longing for a beating, and yet I know
I'll get one, for I've gotten one several times already. How so, you ask? Well, like this: if I say that
in the times I'm telling of, the brave Czech Hussites tailored such a jacket for the Germans,
smashing three successive papist crusades to dust and ashes, just watch how
I'll get it in the head from one side. And if I say that then, in the battles of Vítkov,
Vyšehrad, Žatec, and Německý Brod, the heretics defeated the crusaders
with diabolical aid, the others will take me and flog me. So I prefer to remain silent, and if
I say anything, then with the impartiality of a reporter—to relate the matter, as they say,
*sine ira et studio*, briefly, coolly, factually, and without adding any commentary of my own.

So I will say briefly: in the autumn of 1420, the Polish King Jogajła refused
to accept the Bohemian crown, which the Hussites had offered him. It was decided in Kraków that
this crown would be taken by the Lithuanian Duke Witold, who always wanted to be a king. However,
so as not to excessively irritate the Roman King Sigismund or the Pope,
Witold's nephew, Zygmunt, son of Korybut, was sent to Bohemia. Korybutowicz, at the head
of five thousand Polish knights, stood in Golden Prague in the year 1422, on Saint Stanislaus' Day. But already by Epiphany of the following year, the little prince
had to return to Lithuania—so vexed were the Luxembourger and Odo
Colonna, then Holy Father Martin V, about this Bohemian succession. And what do you say? Already in 1424, on the eve of the Visitation of Mary, Korybutowicz was back in Prague. This time,
against Jogajła and Witold, against the Pope, against the Roman King. That is, as an outlaw and exile. At the head of similar outlaws and exiles.
And no longer in the thousands, as before, but only numbering in the hundreds.

In Prague, meanwhile, the revolution, like Saturn, devoured its own children, and faction struggled with faction. Jan of Želiv, beheaded on the Monday after Reminiscere Sunday in 1422, was already mourned in all churches
as a martyr by May of that same year. Golden Prague also stood up defiantly to Tábor, but here the scythe hit a stone.
Meaning, Jan Žižka, the great warrior. In the Year of Our Lord 1424,
on the second day after the Nones of June, at Malešov, on the Bohyňka river,
Žižka taught the Praguers a terrible lesson. Many, oh, many were the widows and orphans in Prague after that battle.
Who knows, perhaps it was the orphans' tears that caused Jan Žižka
of Trocnov, and later of Kalich, to die shortly thereafter, on the Wednesday before St. Gall's Day, in Přibyslav near the Moravian border. And he was buried in Hradec Králové, and there he lies.
And just as before some wept because of him, now others wept for him. Because he
had orphaned them. That is why they called themselves the Orphans...
But surely you all remember this. For these are quite recent times. And yet they seem...
historical.

6

And do you know, worthy sirs, how to tell that a time is historical? By the fact
that a lot happens, and quickly.
And then, a great deal happened, and very quickly.
The end of the world, as has been said, did not come. Though much indicated that it would. For there came—just as the prophecies willed—great wars and great disasters
for the Christian people, and many men perished. It seemed God Himself willed
that the advent of a new order be preceded by the destruction of the old. It seemed that the Apocalypse was approaching. That the Ten-Horned Beast was emerging from the Abyss. That the Four Horsemen,
terrible, were to be seen at any moment amidst the smoke of fires and bloodstained fields.
That soon, very soon, the trumpets would sound and the seals would be broken. That fire would fall from the heavens. That the Star Wormwood would fall on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. That a maddened man,
when he spied the footprint of another in the ashes, would kiss that footprint
with tears.
It was terrifying at times, so much so that, begging your pardon, noble sirs, one's arse clenched.
It was a dreadful time. Evil. And if it is your will, sirs, I shall tell of it. Just to kill boredom,
before the foul weather that keeps us here in the inn subsides.
I will tell, if you wish, of that time. Of the people who lived then, and of those
who lived then, but were by no means human. I will tell of how
both groups struggled with what that time brought them. With fate. And with themselves.
This story begins sweetly and pleasantly, mistily and tenderly—with delightful, sentimental
love. But let that not deceive you, my dear sirs.
Let that not deceive you.

***

Chapter 1
in which the reader has the opportunity to meet Reinmar of Bielawa, called Reynevan, and that from several of his best sides at once, including a fluent
knowledge of *ars amandi*, the arcana of horsemanship, and the Old Testament, not necessarily in that order. The chapter also speaks of Burgundy—treated
as narrowly as it is broadly.

Through the open window of the small room, against the sky still dark after a recent storm,
three towers were visible—the town hall tower, closest, then the slender tower of Saint John the Evangelist's church, gleaming
in the sun with brand-new red tiles, and behind it, the round
keep of the ducal castle. Swallows darted around the church tower,
startled by the recent ringing of bells. The bells had not rung for quite
a few moments, but the ozone-saturated air still
seemed to vibrate with their sound.
Bells had also rung quite recently from the towers of the churches of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Corpus Christi. These towers, however, were not visible from the little window of the attic room
of the wooden building, stuck like a swallow's nest to the hospice
and Augustinian monastery complex.
It was the hour of Sext. The monks began *Deus in adiutorium*. And Reinmar of Bielawa,
called Reynevan by his friends, kissed the sweaty collarbone of Adela von
Stercza, freed himself from her embrace, and lay beside her, panting,
on the bedclothes hot from love.
From beyond the wall, from Klasztorna Street, came shouts, the rumble of carts, the dull thud of empty barrels, the melodious clinking of pewter and copper vessels. It was
Wednesday, market day, as usual drawing
a multitude of merchants and buyers to Oleśnica.
*Memento, salutis Auctor*
*quod nostri quondam corporis,*
*ex illibata virgine*
8

*nascendo, formam sumpseris.*
*Maria mater gratiae,*
*mater misericordiae,*
*tu nos ab hoste protege,*
*et hora mortis suscipe...*¹
They're already singing the hymn, thought Reynevan, embracing
Adela with a languid movement, she who hailed from distant Burgundy, the wife of Knight Gelfrad von Stercza. Already
the hymn. Unbelievable, how quickly moments of happiness pass. One would wish them
to last forever, and yet they pass like a fleeting dream...
"Reynevan... *Mon amour*... My divine boy..." Adela predatorily
and greedily interrupted his sleepy reverie. She too was aware of the passage of time, but
apparently had no intention of wasting it on philosophical reflections.
Adela was completely, utterly, entirely naked.
Different countries, different customs, thought Reynevan, how very interesting it is to get to know the world and its people. Silesian and German women, for example, when it comes down to it, never
allow their shifts to be pulled up higher than their navels. Polish and Czech women pull
them up themselves, and willingly, above their breasts, but for nothing in the world will they remove them completely. And Burgundian women, oh, they instantly shed everything, their hot blood during amorous
passions evidently cannot bear even a scrap of cloth on their skin. Ah, what joy to get to know
the world. Burgundy must be a beautiful land. Its landscape must be beautiful.
Soaring mountains... Steep hills... Valleys...
"Ah, aaah, *mon amour*," moaned Adela von Stercza, pressing herself
to Reynevan's hand with her entire Burgundian landscape.
Reynevan, incidentally, was twenty-three years old and had seen rather little of the world. He knew very few Czech women, even fewer Silesian and German women, one
Polish woman, one Gypsy woman—and as for other nationalities, he had only once been rejected by a Hungarian woman. His erotic experiences could therefore by no means be counted among the impressive;
nay, they were, frankly speaking, quite meager, both in quantity and quality. But they had still filled him with pride and conceit.
Reynevan—like every testosterone-fueled youth—considered himself a great
seducer and expert in love, before whom the female sex held no secrets. The truth, however, was that his eleven previous trysts with Adela
von Stercza had taught Reynevan more about *ars amandi* than his entire three years of study
in Prague. Reynevan, however, had not realized that Adela was teaching him—he was certain
that his innate talent was at play here.
*Ad te levavi oculos meos*
*qui habitas in caelis*
*Ecce sicut oculi servorum*
*ad manum dominorum suorum.*
9

*Sicut oculi ancillae in manibus dominae suae*
*ita oculi nostri ad Dominum Deum nostrum,*
*Donec misereatur nostri*
*Miserere nostri Domine...*²
Adela seized Reynevan by the nape of his neck and pulled him onto herself. Reynevan, grasping what was appropriate, loved her. He loved her strongly and with abandon and—as if that
were not enough—whispered assurances of love into her ear. He was happy. Very
happy.

***

The happiness Reynevan was currently indulging in, he owed—indirectly, of
course—to the Lord's saints. For it was like this:
Feeling remorse for some sins, known only to him and his confessor,
the Silesian knight Gelfrad von Stercza set out on a penitential pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint
James. But on the way, he changed his plans. He decided that Compostela was definitely
too far, and since Saint Giles hadn't exactly fallen from a magpie's tail either, a pilgrimage to Saint-Gilles would suffice entirely. But Gelfrad
was not destined to reach Saint-Gilles either. He only made it to Dijon, where by chance he met
a sixteen-year-old Burgundian girl, the beautiful Adela de Beauvoisin. Adela, who utterly charmed Gelfrad,
was an orphan, had two rakish and irresponsible brothers,
who without batting an eye married their sister off to the Silesian
knight. Although in the brothers' opinion Silesia lay somewhere between the Tigris and the Euphrates, Stercza was
an ideal brother-in-law in their eyes, as he did not haggle too much over the dowry.
Thus, the Burgundian woman ended up in Heinrichsdorf, a village near Ziębice, which Gelfrad held as a fief. And in Ziębice, now as Adela von Stercza,
she caught the eye of Reynevan of Bielawa. Mutually.
"Aaaach!" cried Adela von Stercza, wrapping her legs around Reynevan's
back. "Aaaaa-aaach!"
This "aahing" would never have happened, it would all have ended with
exchanged glances and furtive gestures, if not for a third saint,
George, namely. For on Saint George's Day, Gelfrad von Stercza, like the rest of the crusaders, cursed
and swore, joining
in September of the year 1422 one of the umpteenth
anti-Hussite crusades, organized by the Elector of Brandenburg
and the Margraves of Meissen. The crusaders did not record great successes on their account then—they entered Bohemia and very quickly left it, not risking
combat with the Hussites at all. But although there were no battles, there were casualties—one of them turned
out to be Gelfrad himself, who broke his leg extremely badly in a fall from his horse
10

and currently, as indicated by letters sent to his family, was still recuperating somewhere
in Pleissenland. Adela, meanwhile, a grass widow, living at that time
with her husband's family in Bierutów, could meet Reynevan without hindrance
in the little room in the Oleśnica Augustinian monastery complex, near the hospital
where Reynevan had his workshop.

***

The monks in the Church of Corpus Christi began to sing the second of the three psalms
scheduled for Sext. We must hurry, thought Reynevan. By the *capitulum*,
or at the latest by the *Kyrie*, not a moment after, Adela must disappear
from the hospice grounds. No one should see her here.
*Benedictus Dominus*
*qui non dedit nos*
*in captionem dentibus eorum.*
*Anima nostra sicut passer erepta est*
*de laqueo venantium...*
Reynevan kissed Adela on the hip, then, inspired by the monks' singing,
drew a deep breath into his lungs and delved into the flowers of henna and nard, into saffron,
into fragrant calamus and cinnamon, into myrrh and aloes, and into all resinous trees. Adela, stretched out, straightened her arms and dug her fingers into his hair, with gentle movements
of her hips supporting his biblical initiatives.
"Oh, ooooooh... *Mon amour*... *Mon magicien*... Divine boy... Magician..."
*Qui confidunt in Domino, sicut mons Sion*
*non commovebitur in aeternum,*
*qui habitat in Hierusalem...*
Already the third psalm, thought Reynevan. How fleeting are the moments of happiness...
"*Revertere*," he purred, kneeling. "Turn, turn, O Shulamite."
Adela turned, knelt, and leaned forward, gripping
the linden wood headboard firmly and presenting
Reynevan with all the dazzling beauty of her reverse. Aphrodite Kallipygos, he thought, approaching her. The classical association and erotic
sight made him approach like the aforementioned Saint George, charging
with levelled spear at the dragon of Silene. Kneeling behind Adela like King Solomon
behind the throne of Lebanese wood, he grasped her with both hands by the vineyards of Engedi.
11

"To a mare in Pharaoh's chariot," he whispered, bent over her neck,
shapely as the tower of David, "I compare you, my love."
And he compared. Adela cried out through clenched teeth. Reynevan slowly slid
his hands along her sweat-slicked sides, climbed
the palm tree and seized its fruit-laden branches.
The Burgundian threw back her head like a mare before a jump
over an obstacle.
*Quia non relinquet Dominus virgam peccatorum,*
*super sortem iustorum*
*ut non extendant iusti*
*ad iniquitatem manus suas...*
Adela's breasts bounced under Reynevan's hand like two fawns,
twin gazelles.
He placed his other hand under her pomegranate grove.
"*Duo... ubera tua*," he moaned, "*sicut duo... hinuli capreae gemelli... qui*
*pascuntur... in liliis... Umbilicus tuus crater... tornatilis numquam... indigens*
*poculis... Venter tuus... sicut acervus... tritici vallatus liliis...*"
"Ach... aaaach... aaach..." counterpointed the Burgundian woman, who did not know Latin.
*Gloria Patri, et Filio et Spiritui sancto.*
*Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper*
*et in saecula saeculorum, Amen.*
*Alleluia!*
The monks sang. And Reynevan, kissing Adela von Stercza's neck, with abandon,
frenzied, running through the mountains, leaping over the hills, *saliens in montibus, transiliens colles*, was for his lover like a young stag on the mountains of spices. *Super
montes aromatum.*

***

The struck door flew open with a bang and such force that the bolt, torn
from the doorframe, flew out the window like a meteor. Adela shrieked thinly and terrifyingly. And into the small room burst the von Stercza brothers. It was immediately apparent
that this was not a friendly visit.
Reynevan rolled off the bed, shielded by it from the intruders, grabbed his clothes and began
to put them on hastily. He succeeded to a large extent, but only
because the Stercza brothers directed their frontal attack towards their sister-in-law.
12

"You whore!" roared Morold von Stercza, dragging naked Adela from the bedclothes. "You disgusting whore!"
"You loose slut!" chimed in Wittich, his older brother. While Wolfher, the eldest after Gelfrad, didn't even open his mouth, pale rage had
robbed him of speech. He struck Adela across the face with a swing. The Burgundian shrieked. Wolfher
followed up, this time with a backhand.
"Don't you dare hit her, Stercza!" shouted Reynevan, his voice breaking
and trembling with panic and a paralyzing
feeling of helplessness, caused by his half-pulled-up
trousers. "Don't you dare, do you hear?"
The shout had an effect, though not entirely the intended one. Wolfher and Wittich, forgetting
for a moment about their unfaithful sister-in-law, leaped at Reynevan. A hail of blows and kicks rained down on the boy. He cowered under the blows, instead of defending himself or
shielding himself, stubbornly pulling up his trousers—as if they weren't trousers at all, but
some magical armor capable of protecting and shielding him from wounds, some enchanted
cuirass of Astolfo or Amadis of Gaul. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Wittich draw a knife.
Adela shrieked.
"Leave him," Wolfher snarled at his brother. "Not here!"
Reynevan managed to rise to his knees. Wittich, enraged, his face white with fury,
dashed forward and punched him, sending him to the floor again. Adela
cried out shrilly, the cry cut short as Morold struck her in the face and pulled her
by the hair.
"Don't you dare..." Reynevan moaned, "...hit her, scoundrels!"
"You son of a bitch!" Wittich screamed. "Just you wait!"
He jumped forward, struck, kicked once, twice. On the third, Wolfher stopped
him.
"Not here," he repeated calmly, and it was an ominous calm. "To the courtyard
with him. We're taking him to Bierutów. This whore too."
"I am innocent!" wailed Adela von Stercza. "He bewitched me!
Enchanted me! He's a sorcerer! *Le sorcier! Le diab...*"
Morold cut off the word, stifled it with a blow.
"Silence, you strumpet," he snarled. "We'll give you a chance to scream yet.
Just wait a little."
"Don't you dare hit her!" screamed Reynevan.
"You too," Wolfher added with his menacing calm, "we'll give you a chance to scream, little cockerel. Come on, out with him."
The way from the attic led down rather steep stairs. The von Stercza brothers threw
Reynevan down them; the boy fell onto the landing, smashing
part of the wooden balustrade with his body. Before he could rise, they grabbed him again and threw him straight onto
the courtyard, onto sand decorated with steaming
piles of horse manure.

13

"Well, well, well," said Niklas Stercza, the youngest of the brothers, merely a youth, holding the horses. "Who's this that fell to us? Could it be Reinmar
Bielau?"
"The well-read smart-arse Bielau," snorted Jencz von Knobelsdorf, known as Puchacz (Eagle-Owl), a kinsman and crony of the Sterczas, standing over Reynevan as he scrambled
from the sand. "The loud-mouthed smart-arse
Bielau!"
"A damned poet," added Dieter Haxt, another friend of the family. "A regular Abelard!"
"And to prove to him that we too are well-read," said Wolfher, descending the stairs, "we'll do to him the same thing that was done to Abelard, when caught with Heloise.
Exactly the same. Well, Bielawa? How does being a capon appeal to you?"
"Fuck yourself, Stercza."
"What? What?" Though it seemed impossible, Wolfher Stercza turned
even paler. "The little cockerel still dares to open his beak? Dares
to crow? Give me the bullwhip, Jencz!"
"Don't you dare hit him!" Adela, now dressed, though incompletely, being brought down the
stairs, screamed completely unexpectedly. "Don't you dare! Or I'll tell everyone
what you're like! That you yourself made advances to me, pawed me, and tried to seduce me
into debauchery! Behind your brother's back! That you promised me revenge when I drove you away!
That's why you're like this now... Like this..."
She lacked the German word, which ruined the whole tirade. Wolfher
only laughed.
"Indeed!" he scoffed. "Who's going to listen to a Frenchwoman, a common whore.
The bullwhip, Puchacz!"
The courtyard suddenly darkened with Augustinian habits.
"What's happening here?" cried the venerable prior Erazm Steinkeller, a thin
and very sallow old man. "What are you doing, Christians?"
"Get lost!" roared Wolfher, cracking the bullwhip. "Away, shaven pates,
away, to your breviaries, to your prayers! Don't meddle in knightly affairs, or
you'll be sorry, blackrobes!"
"Lord," the prior folded his liver-spotted hands, "forgive them,
for they know not what they do. *In nomine Patris, et Filii...*"
"Morold, Wittich!" screamed Wolfher. "Bring the strumpet here! Jencz, Dieter, fetter the gosling!"
"And perhaps," sneered Stefan Rotkirch, another friend of the house, who had been silent until then, "we could drag him a bit behind a horse?"
"Could be. But first, I'll flog him!"
He aimed the whip at the still-lying Reynevan, but did not strike, his hand caught by Brother Innocent. Brother Innocent was of considerable height and build, which was evident even despite his humble monastic stoop. His grip
immobilized Wolfher's hand like an iron club.
14

Stercza cursed obscenely, wrenched himself free, and forcefully pushed the monk. But he might as well have pushed the keep of Oleśnica castle. Brother Innocent, nicknamed "Brother Insolent" by his confreres, did not even flinch. He, however,
retaliated with a shove that sent Wolfher halfway across the courtyard and knocked him onto a dung heap.
For a moment, there was silence. And then everyone rushed at the large monk. Puchacz, the first to reach him, got a fist in the teeth and rolled in the sand.
Morold Stercza, hit in the ear, staggered sideways with a dazed look. The rest
swarmed the Augustinian like ants. The large figure in the black habit completely disappeared under the blows and kicks. Brother Insolent, though soundly beaten, retaliated just as soundly and completely unchristianly, entirely, but entirely against
the humble rule of Saint Augustine.
At this sight, the old prior became agitated. He turned red as a cherry,
 roared like a lion, and threw himself into the battle's thickest fray, striking
right and left with fierce blows from his rosewood crucifix.
"*Pax!*" he screamed, striking. "*Pax! Vobiscum!* Love thy neighbor! Thine own! *Proximum tuum! Sicut te ipsum!* Sons of bitches!"
Dieter Haxt punched him. The old man's legs went out from under him, his sandals flew upwards, describing picturesque trajectories in the air. The Augustinians
raised a cry, and several of them couldn't restrain themselves and rushed into the fray. The courtyard seethed
in earnest.
Pushed out of the melee, Wolfher Stercza drew his short sword and brandished it—blood threatened
to flow. But Reynevan, who had already managed to get up, struck him on the back of the head
with the handle of a bullwhip he had picked up from the ground. Stercza clutched his head and turned,
at which point Reynevan lashed him across the face with the whip; Wolfher fell.
Reynevan lunged for the horses.
"Adela! Here! To me!"
Adela didn't even flinch, and the indifference on her face was astonishing.
Reynevan jumped into the saddle. The horse neighed and danced.
"Adeeelaaa!"
Morold, Wittich, Haxt, and Puchacz were already running towards him. Reynevan turned his horse,
whistled piercingly, and galloped off, straight for the gate.
"After him!" roared Wolfher Stercza. "Mount up and after him!"
Reynevan's first thought was to flee towards the Mariacka Gate and then,
out of the city, into the Spalickie Woods. Krowia Street, however, turned out to be
completely choked with carts in the direction of the gate, and the horse, urged on and frightened by shouts,
showed a great deal of its own initiative, as a result of which, before he had properly
grasped the situation, Reynevan was already galloping towards the market square, splashing
mud and scattering pedestrians. He didn't need to look back
to know that the pursuit was on his heels. He heard the thundering of hooves, the neighing of horses, the wild roars of the Sterczas, and the furious
shouts of the people being knocked over.
15

He struck the horse with his heel in the flank, in full gallop he snagged and knocked over a baker carrying
a basket; loaves, rolls, and croissants flew like hail into the mud, into which the hooves of the Sterczas' horses
would soon trample them. Reynevan didn't even look back, more interested in what was
ahead of him than what was behind him, and ahead of him, a cart piled high
with brushwood was growing in his vision. The cart blocked almost the entire alley, and in the place
it didn't block, a group of half-naked children was squatting, busy digging
something extremely interesting out of the manure.
"We've got you, Bielau!" roared Wolfher Stercza from behind, also seeing
what was on the road.
The horse was tearing along so fast that there was no question of stopping it. Reynevan pressed himself to
the mane and closed his eyes. Thanks to this, he didn't see how the half-naked children
scattered with the speed and grace of rats. He didn't look back, so he also didn't see
how the peasant in a sheepskin coat, pulling the cart with brushwood, turned around, somewhat stupefied,
turning the shaft and the cart at the same time. Nor did he see how the Sterczas
crashed into the turned cart. Nor how Jencz Knobelsdorf flew
from his saddle and swept away half of the brushwood on the cart with his body.
Reynevan galloped through Świętojańska Street, between the town hall and the mayor's house,
and at full speed burst into the enormous Oleśnica market square. The problem was that
the market square, though huge, was teeming with people. And pandemonium broke out. Heading
for the southern frontage and the stout quadrilateral of the tower above
the Oławska Gate visible above it, Reynevan galloped among people, horses, oxen, pigs, carts,
and stalls, leaving a battlefield behind him. People screamed, wailed, and cursed,
cattle bellowed, pigs squealed, stalls and benches overturned, from which
a hail of various objects flew around: pots, bowls, tubs, hoes,
pokers, fishing weirs, sheepskins, felt caps, linden spoons, tallow candles, bast shoes, and clay cockerels with whistles. Food products also rained down around
—eggs, cheeses, baked goods, peas, groats, carrots, turnips, onions,
even live crayfish. All sorts of poultry flew in clouds of feathers and shrieked in various voices. The Sterczas, still
on Reynevan's heels, completed the work
of destruction.
Startled by a goose flying right past his nose, Reynevan's horse shied
and crashed into a fish stall, smashing crates and overturning
barrels. The enraged fisherman swung his fish basket with force, missing
Reynevan, but hitting
the horse's rump. The horse neighed and bolted sideways, overturning
a portable stall with threads and ribbons; for a few seconds, it danced in place, splashing
in a silvery and stinking
mass of roach, bream, and carp, mixed with a riot of colorful
spools. Reynevan only avoided falling by a miracle. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the thread seller
running towards him with a large axe, God only knows what purpose it served
in the thread trade. He spat out goose feathers stuck to his lips, controlled the horse, and galloped into Rzeźnicza (Butcher's) Street, from where, as he knew, the Oławska Gate
was very close.
16

"I'll rip your balls off, Bielawa!" roared Wolfher Stercza from behind. "I'll rip them off and
shove them down your throat!"
"Kiss my arse!"
There were only four pursuers left—Rotkirch had been pulled from his horse and was
currently being roughed up by enraged market vendors.
Reynevan sped like an arrow through an alley of hanging
carcasses. Butchers leaped out of the way in panic, but he still knocked over one carrying
a large leg of beef on his shoulder. The fallen man tumbled
with the leg under the hooves of Wittich's horse; the horse
shied and reared, Wolfher's horse crashed into it from behind. Wittich flew
from the saddle straight onto a butcher's counter, nose-first into livers,
lights, and kidneys; Wolfher fell on top of him. His foot got stuck in the stirrup; before he freed himself,
he had demolished a considerable part of the shambles and was covered head to toe in mud and gore.
Reynevan quickly and at the last moment ducked onto the horse's neck, thus
fitting under a wooden sign with a painted pig's head. Dieter Haxt, following
close on his heels, didn't manage to duck. The board with the likeness
of a joyfully smiling pig struck him on the forehead with a resounding thwack. Dieter flew
from the saddle, landed on a pile of refuse, startling cats. Reynevan looked back. Only Niklas was chasing
him now.
At a full gallop, he burst out of the butchers' alley onto a small square where
tanners were working. And when a frame hung with wet hides suddenly loomed
before his nose, he reared his horse and forced it to jump. The horse jumped. And Reynevan didn't
fall. Again, by a miracle.
Niklas wasn't so lucky. His horse dug in its heels before the frame and rammed
it, sliding in the mud, scraps of meat, and greasy offal. The youngest Stercza
somersaulted over the horse's head. Very, very unfortunately. His groin and belly
straight onto a fleshing knife left by the tanners.
Initially, Niklas didn't comprehend at all what had happened. He scrambled to his feet,
reached his horse, and only when the steed snorted and backed away, did his knees
buckle and break beneath him. Still not quite knowing what was happening, the youngest Stercza slid through the mud after his retreating and panickedly snorting
horse. Finally, he let go of the
reins and tried to stand. He realized something was wrong, looked at his
belly. And screamed.
He knelt amidst a rapidly growing pool of blood.
Dieter Haxt rode up, reined in his horse, and dismounted. Wolfher and Wittich Stercza did the same
a moment later.
Niklas sat down heavily. He looked again at his belly. He screamed,
and then burst into tears. His eyes began to cloud over—the blood gushing
from him mixed with the blood of oxen and pigs slaughtered there that morning.
"Niklaaaas!"
Niklas Stercza coughed, choked. And died.

17

"You're already dead, Reynevan Bielau!" roared Wolfher Stercza, pale
with rage, towards the gate. "I'll catch you, kill you, destroy you, exterminate you along
with your entire viperous kin! Along with your entire viperous kin, do you hear?"
Reynevan didn't hear. Amidst the clatter of hooves on the bridge planks, he was just riding
out of Oleśnica and heading south, straight onto the Wrocław road.

***

Chapter 2
in which the reader learns even more about Reynevan, from conversations
various people have about him, both well-wishers and those quite the opposite.
Meanwhile, Reynevan himself wanders through the forests near Oleśnica. The author
is sparing with descriptions of this wandering, so the reader, *nolens volens*, must
imagine it for themselves.

"Sit down, sit down at the table, gentlemen," invited Bartłomiej Sachs,
the mayor of Oleśnica. "What shall I have served? Of wines, frankly speaking, I have nothing
with which I could impress. But beer, oho, it was delivered to me straight from Świdnica today,
prime brew, first wort, from a deep, cold cellar."
"Beer then, beer, Master Bartłomiej," Jan Hofrichter, one
of the city's wealthier merchants, rubbed his hands. "Beer is our drink, let the gentry
and various dandies sour their innards with wine... With your reverence's pardon..."
"It's nothing," smiled Father Jakub von Gall, pastor of Saint
John the Evangelist. "I am no longer a nobleman, I am a plebeian. And a plebeian, as the name itself
suggests, is always with the people, so it ill befits me to disdain beer either. And I can
drink, for vespers have been said."
They sat at the table, in the large, low-ceilinged, starkly whitewashed town hall room, the usual
place for magistrate meetings. The mayor in his usual chair, back to the fireplace, Father
Gall beside him, facing the window. Hofrichter sat opposite, next to him
Łukasz Frydman, a renowned and wealthy goldsmith, in his fashionably padded doublet
and velvet roundlet on his coiffed head, looking
every bit a nobleman.
The mayor cleared his throat, not waiting for the servants with the beer, and began.
"And what have we here?" he spoke, clasping his hands over his prominent belly. "What
have the noble, belted knights deigned to treat us to in our town? A brawl at the Augustinians. Horse,
that is, races through the city streets. Tumult in the market square, several injured, including one child seriously. Damaged
property, ruined goods. Significant, that is, material losses; *mercatores et institores*
were practically pushing their way in here with demands for compensation.
Truly, I should be sending them with their claims to the Stercza lords, to Bierutów, Ledna, and Sterzendorf."
"Better not," Jan Hofrichter advised dryly. "Though I too am of the opinion that the noble knights have lately become excessively unruly, one must not forget either
the causes of the matter, or its consequences. The consequence, a tragic consequence,
is the death of young Niklas de Stercza. And the cause: lechery and debauchery.
The Sterczas were defending their brother's honor, chasing the gosling who seduced their sister-in-law, defiled
the marital bed. True, in their zeal, they overdid it a bit..."
The merchant fell silent under the significant gaze of Father Jakub. For when Father
Jakub signaled with a look his desire to speak, even the mayor himself fell silent.
Jakub Gall was not only the pastor of the town parish, but also the secretary of Duke Konrad of Oleśnica and a canon in the Wrocław cathedral chapter.
"Adultery is a sin," spoke the priest, straightening his thin
figure at the table. "Adultery is also a crime. But God punishes sins,
and the law punishes crimes. Lynchings and murders are justified by nothing."
"That's it, that's it," the mayor interjected, but immediately fell silent and devoted himself to the beer,
which had just been served.
"Niklas Stercza, which pains us greatly," added Father Gall, "died tragically,
but as a result of an unfortunate accident. But if Wolfher and his company had caught
Reinmar de Bielau, we would be dealing with murder in our jurisdiction.
It is not known, moreover, whether we will not. I remind you that Prior Steinkeller,
a saintly old man severely beaten by the Sterczas, lies unconscious at the Augustinians. If he dies from this beating, there will be a problem. For the Sterczas, precisely."
"As for the crime of adultery," goldsmith Łukasz Frydman
examined the rings on his well-groomed fingers, "consider,
honorable sirs, that it is not our jurisdiction at all. Although
debauchery took place in Oleśnica, the delinquents are not subject to us. Gelfrad Stercza, the betrayed
husband, is a vassal of the Duke of Ziębice. Similarly, the seducer, young medic Reinmar de Bielau..."
"The debauchery happened here, and the crime was here," Hofrichter said firmly. "And not a trivial one, if one is to believe what Stercza's wife confessed at the Augustinians. That the medicus bewitched her with charms and led her to sin through sorcery.
Forced her against her will."
"They all say that," boomed the mayor from within his tankard.
"Especially," the goldsmith added without emotion, "when someone like Wolfher de Stercza holds a knife to their throat. Reverend Father Jakub said it well, that
adultery is a crime, *crimen*, and as such requires investigation and trial. We
do not want family feuds or street battles here, we will not allow unruly
nobles to raise a hand against clergy here, brandish knives, and trample people in
the squares. In Świdnica, for striking an armorer and threatening him with a sword, one of the Pannewitzes
went to the tower.
20

And so it should be. The times of knightly lawlessness cannot return.
The matter must go before the Duke."
"All the more so," confirmed the mayor with a nod, "because Reinmar
of Bielawa is a nobleman, and Adela Sterczowa is a noblewoman. We cannot
flog him or banish her from the city like any common strumpet. The matter must go before
the Duke."
"There is no need to rush this," assessed Pastor Jakub
Gall, looking at the ceiling. "Duke Konrad is leaving for Wrocław, and before his departure, he has countless matters
on his mind. Rumors, as rumors do, have probably already reached him, but it is not the time to
make these rumors official. It will be enough to present the matter to the Duke when he returns. By then,
much may resolve itself."
"I also think so," Bartłomiej Sachs nodded again.
"And I," added the goldsmith.
Jan Hofrichter adjusted his marten fur cap, blew the foam from his tankard.
"There's no need to inform the Duke for now," he declared, "we'll wait until he returns,
in this I agree with you, honorable sirs. But we must notify the Holy Office.
And quickly. About what we found in the medicus's workshop. Don't shake
your head, Master Bartłomiej, don't make faces, worthy Master Łukasz. And you, reverend sir, don't
sigh and count flies on the ceiling. I am as eager for this as you are, I
desire the Inquisition here as much as you do. But many people were present at the opening of the workshop.
And where there are many people, there will always be, I don't think I'm being very original, at
least one who informs the Inquisition. And when the visitor appears in Oleśnica,
he will ask us first why we delayed."
"And I," Pastor Gall tore his gaze from the ceiling, "will explain the delay. I,
personally. For it is my parish and on me rests the duty
of informing the bishop and the papal inquisitor. It is also up to me to assess whether circumstances have arisen
that justify summoning and troubling the curia and the Office."
"The witchcraft Adela Sterczowa screamed about at the Augustinians,
is that not a circumstance? The workshop is not? The alchemical alembic and the pentagram on
the floor are not? Mandrake? Skulls, dead hands? Crystals and mirrors? Bottles and flasks with God knows what filth or poison? Frogs and lizards in jars? Are these not circumstances?"
"They are not. The inquisitors are serious men. Their business is the *inquisitio de articulis fidei*. Not old wives' tales, superstitions, and frogs; I have no intention of bothering them
with such things."
"And the books? Those lying here?"
"The books," Jakub Gall replied calmly, "must first be studied.
Thoroughly and without haste. The Holy Office does not forbid reading. Nor the possession
of books."
"In Wrocław," Hofrichter said grimly, "two just went to
the stake. Word has it, precisely for the books they possessed."
21

"Not for books at all," the pastor contradicted dryly, "but for contumacy,
for a defiant refusal to renounce the content proclaimed, contained in those books.
Among which were writings of Wycliffe and Hus, the Lollard *Floretus*, the Prague
Articles, and numerous other Hussite libels and manifestos. I see nothing similar
here, among the books confiscated from Reinmar of Bielawa's workshop. I see here
almost exclusively medical works. Which are, moreover, mostly, or even entirely,
the property of the Augustinian monastery's scriptorium."
"I repeat," Jan Hofrichter stood up, approached the books laid out on the table.
"I repeat, I am not at all eager for either the episcopal or the papal
inquisition, I do not want to denounce anyone or see anyone sizzling
on the stake. But our own arses are on the line here too. Lest we also be accused because of these books. And what do we
have here? Besides Galen, Pliny, and Strabo? Saladinus de Asculo, *Compendium
aromatorium*. Scribonius Largus, *Compositiones medicamentorum*. Bartholomeus
Anglicus, *De proprietatibus rerum*, Albertus Magnus, *De vegetalibus et plantis*...
Magnus, ha, a name truly worthy of a sorcerer. And here, please, Sabur ben
Sahl... Abu Bekr al-Razi... Pagans! Saracens!"
"These Saracens," Łukasz Frydman explained calmly, examining
his rings, "are taught at Christian universities. As medical
authorities. And your sorcerer is Albertus Magnus, Bishop of Regensburg, a learned theologian."
"So you say? Hmmm... Let's look further... Oh! *Causae et curae*, written
by Hildegard of Bingen. Probably a witch, this Hildegard!"
"Not quite," Father Gall smiled. "Hildegard of Bingen,
prophetess, called the Sibyl of the Rhine. Died in an aura of sanctity."
"Ha. But if you say so... And what is this? John Gerard, *Generall...
Historie... of Plantes*... Interesting, what language is this, Hebrew perhaps. But this is probably
another saint. And here we have *Herbarius*, by Thomas de Bohemia..."
"What did you say?" Father Jakub raised his head. "Thomas the Czech?"
"So it says here."
"Show me. Hmmm... Interesting, interesting... Everything, as it turns out, stays
in the family. And revolves around the family."
"What family?"
"So familial," Łukasz Frydman still seemed interested only
in his rings, "that it couldn't be more so. Thomas the Czech, or Behem, author
of this *Herbarius*, is the great-grandfather of our Reinmar, the lover of other men's wives, who has caused
us so much trouble and bother."
"Tomasz Behem, Tomasz Behem," the mayor furrowed his brow. "Also known as Tomasz the Medic. I've heard of him. He was a friend of one of the dukes... I
don't remember..."
"Duke Henry VI of Wrocław," goldsmith Frydman hastened with a calm explanation. "Indeed, this Tomasz was his friend. He was reportedly
an outstanding
22

scholar, a capable physician. He studied in Padua, Salerno, and Montpellier..."
"They also said," Hofrichter interjected, having for some moments been nodding his head in confirmation
that he too remembered, "that he was a sorcerer and a heretic."
"You're stuck on that sorcery like a leech, Master Jan," the mayor grimaced. "Give it a rest."
"Tomasz Behem," the pastor instructed in a slightly stern voice, "was a clergyman.
A Wrocław canon, then even a suffragan bishop of the diocese. And titular
bishop of Sarepta. He personally knew Pope Benedict XII."
"Various things were also said about that pope," Hofrichter was not about to give up.
"And sorcery has occurred even among prelates. Inquisitor Schwenckefeld,
in his time..."
"Leave it be, finally," Father Jakub cut him off. "Something else should concern us here."
"Indeed," confirmed the goldsmith. "I, for one, know what. Duke Henryk
had no male heir, only three daughters. With the youngest, Małgorzata,
our Father Tomasz allowed himself an affair."
"The Duke allowed it? Was the friendship that strong?"
"The Duke was no longer alive then," the goldsmith explained again. "Duchess Anna
either didn't see what was happening, or didn't want to see. Tomasz Behem
was not yet a bishop then, but he was on excellent terms with the rest of Silesia:
with Henryk the Faithful of Głogów, Casimir of Cieszyn and Frysztat,
Bolko the Small of Świdnica-Jawor, Władysław of Bytom-Koźle, Louis
of Brzeg. For indeed, imagine, gentlemen, someone who not only
visits the Holy Father in Avignon, but can also remove
kidney stones so skillfully that the patient not only still has his prick after the operation, but it even
gets hard. If not every day, then still. Though it may sound like a jest,
I am by no means joking. It is commonly believed that it is thanks to Tomasz
that we still have Piasts in Silesia today.
He helped men and women with equal skill. And also couples, if you gentlemen understand what I mean."
"I'm afraid," said the mayor, "that I don't."
"He could help a couple who were not succeeding in the bedchamber. Now do you understand?"
"Now I do," Jan Hofrichter nodded. "Meaning he probably also
bedded the Wrocław princess according to medical art. Naturally, there was a
child from it."
"Naturally," confirmed Father Jakub. "The matter was handled in the usual fashion.
Małgorzata was locked up with the Poor Clares, the child ended up in Oleśnica, with Duke Konrad. Konrad raised him as a son. Tomasz Behem became an ever greater
figure, everywhere, in Silesia, in Prague with Emperor Charles IV, in Avignon, so the boy's career was assured from childhood. A clerical career, of
23

course. Dependent on what intelligence he displayed. If he were stupid, he would get
a country parish. If he were moderately stupid, he would be made an abbot somewhere with the Cistercians.
If he were wise, a chapter in one of the collegiate churches awaited him."
"How did he turn out?"
"Not stupid. Handsome like his father. And valiant. Before anyone could
do anything, the future priest was already fighting with the Greater Polanders alongside the younger
duke, the future Konrad the Elder. He fought so bravely that there was no choice,
he was knighted. With a fief. Thus died little Father Tymo,
long live Ritter Tymo Behem of Bielawa, von Bielau. Knight Tymo, who soon
made a good match, marrying the youngest daughter of Heidenreich Nostitz."
"Nostitz gave his daughter to a cleric's bastard?"
"The cleric, father of the bastard, had meanwhile become Wrocław's suffragan and Bishop
of Sarepta, knew the Holy Father, advised Wenceslaus IV, and was on familiar
terms with all the Silesian dukes. Old Heidenreich probably offered
him his little daughter himself, and willingly."
"That's possible."
"From the union of Nostitz's daughter with Tymo de Bielau, Henryk and Tomasz were born.
In Henryk, the grandfather's blood evidently spoke, for he became a priest, studied
in Prague, and until his death, quite recent, was a scholastic at Holy Cross
in Wrocław. Tomasz, on the other hand, married Boguszka, daughter of Miksza of Prochowice,
and fathered two children with her. Piotr, called Peterlin, and Reinmar, called
Reynevan. Peterlin, or Parsley, and Reynevan, or Tansy. Such
vegetable-herbal cognomens, I have no idea, whether they came up with them themselves or it was
their father's fancy. He, by the way, if we're on the subject, fell at Tannenberg."
"On whose side?"
"On ours, the Christian side."
Jan Hofrichter nodded, took a sip from his tankard.
"And this Reinmar-Reynevan, who is wont to meddle with other men's wives... What is he
to the Augustinians? An oblate? A converse? A novice?"
"Reinmar Bielau," Father Jakub smiled, "is a medic, trained
in Prague, at Charles University. Even before his studies, the boy learned
at the cathedral school in Wrocław, then he learned the secrets of herbalism from
Świdnica apothecaries and from the Brothers of the Holy Spirit at the Brzeg hospice. It was precisely the Brothers of the Holy Spirit and his uncle
Henryk, the Wrocław scholastic, who placed him with our Augustinians, who specialized in herbal treatment. The boy worked honestly and with heart, proving his vocation,
for the hospital and leper-house. Then, as mentioned, he studied medicine
in Prague, also with his uncle's protection and with money
his uncle had from a canonry.
He evidently applied himself to his studies, because after only two years he was a Bachelor of Arts,
*artium baccalaureus*. He left Prague immediately after... Hmm..."
"Immediately after the defenestration," the mayor was not afraid to finish. "Which clearly
shows that he has nothing to do with the Hussite, that is, heresy."
24

"He has nothing to do with it," goldsmith Frydman confirmed calmly. "I know
this well from my son, who was also studying in Prague at that time."
"It was also very good," Mayor Sachs added, "that Reynevan
returned to Silesia, and good that he came to us, to Oleśnica, not to the Duchy of Ziębice,
where his brother serves as a knight to Duke Jan. He is a good and intelligent boy, though
young, and so skilled in herbal healing that you will find few like him. He cured my wife's
boils, which appeared on her, that is, body, and healed my daughter of a persistent cough.
He gave me a decoction for my eyes, which were festering; it cleared up, as if by magic..."
The mayor fell silent, cleared his throat, and thrust his hands into the fur-lined sleeves of his delia coat.
Jan Hofrichter looked at him sharply.
"This way," he declared, "my head has finally cleared.
About this Reynevan. I know everything now. Though by bastardly means, but of Piast
blood. Son of a bishop. Favorite of dukes. Kinsman of the Nostitzes. Nephew of a
Wrocław collegiate scholastic. A study companion for the sons of the wealthy. On
top of that, as if that weren't enough, a renowned medic, almost a miracle worker, able to
ingratiate himself with the powerful. And what did he cure you of, Reverend Father Jakub?
From what ailment, out of curiosity?"
"Ailments," said the priest coldly, "are no subject for debate. Let us say, then, without details, that he cured me."
"Such a person," added the mayor, "is not worth losing. It's a pity to let such a one
perish in a family feud merely because he forgot himself for a pair of beautiful,
that is, eyes. Let him serve the community. Let him heal, since he knows how..."
"Even," Hofrichter snorted, "using a pentagram on the floor?"
"If he heals," Father Gall said seriously, "if he helps, if he soothes
pain, then even so. Such abilities are a gift from God; the Lord bestows them according to His will
and according to a plan known only to Him. *Spiritus flat, ubi vult*, it is not for us to fathom His ways."
"Amen," concluded the mayor.
"In short," Hofrichter did not give up, "someone like Reynevan
cannot be guilty? Is that it? Eh?"
"Let him who is without sin," Jakub Gall replied with a stony face, "cast
the first stone. And God will judge us all."
For a moment, there was silence, so deep that one could hear the rustling of moths' wings,
beating against the windows. From Świętojańska Street came the drawn-out
and melodious call of the city watchman.
"So then, to summarize," the mayor straightened up behind the table so that his
belly pressed against it, "the Stercza brothers are to blame for the tumult in our town of Oleśnica.
The Sterczas are to blame for the material damage and bodily injuries in the market square.
The Stercza brothers are to blame for the loss of health, and God forbid, the death of His Reverence Prior Ste-
25

inkeller, the Stercza brothers are to blame. They and only they. And what happened to
Niklas von Stercza was an unfortunate, that is, accident. This is how I will present the matter to the Duke,
as soon as he returns. Is there agreement?"
"There is agreement."
"*Consensus omnium.*"
"*Concordi voce.*"
"And if Reynevan should appear somewhere," Pastor Gall added after a moment of silence, "I advise capturing him quietly and locking him up. Here, in our town hall dungeon. For his own safety. Until the matter dies down."
"It would be good," added Łukasz Frydman, examining his rings,
"to do it quickly. Before Tammo Stercza learns of the whole affair."

***

Exiting the town hall straight into the darkness of Świętojańska Street, the merchant Hofrichter caught
a movement out of the corner of his eye on the moonlit wall of the tower, a shifting,
indistinct shape, slightly below the windows of the city trumpeter, and above the windows
of the chamber where the council had just ended. He looked, shielding his eyes from
the interfering light of the lantern carried by his servant. What the devil, he thought,
and immediately crossed himself. What's that crawling on the wall? An eagle-owl? An owl? A bat?
Or perhaps...
Jan Hofrichter shuddered, crossed himself again, pulled his marten-fur cap down over his ears,
wrapped himself in his fur coat, and briskly set off towards home.
He did not see, therefore, how the great wallcreeper spread its wings, flew down
from the windowsill, and silently, like a ghost, like a nocturnal phantom, soared over the rooftops of the city.

***

Apeczko Stercza, lord of Ledna, did not like visiting Sterzendorf castle. The reason was singular and simple—Sterzendorf was the seat of Tammo von Stercza, the head, senior, and patriarch of the clan. Or, as some said—the tyrant, despot,
and tormentor.
The chamber was stuffy. And dark. Tammo von Stercza did not allow the windows to be opened
for fear of catching a draft; the shutters also had to be kept constantly closed, because
the light hurt the cripple's eyes.

26

Apeczko was hungry. And dusty from his journey. But there was no time for a meal,
nor for tidying up. Old Stercza did not like to wait. Nor was he accustomed to offering hospitality
to guests. Especially family.
Apeczko therefore swallowed saliva to moisten his throat—nothing to drink had been offered
him, of course—and recounted the Oleśnica events to Tammo. He did so
reluctantly, but well, he had to. Cripple or not, paralytic or not, Tammo was the senior
of the clan. A senior who did not tolerate disobedience.
The old man listened to the account, sprawled in his chair in his usual, unbelievably awkward posture. The old twisted gingerbread man, thought Apeczko. The damned broken old codger.³
The causes of the state in which the patriarch of the Stercza clan found himself were not entirely and not to everyone known. There was agreement on one thing—Tammo had suffered
a stroke, because Tammo had become enraged. Some claimed that the old man had become enraged at
the news that his personal enemy, the hated Duke Konrad of Wrocław, had received
episcopal consecration and become the most powerful figure in Silesia.
Still others asserted that the fateful outburst was caused by his mother-in-law, Anna of Pogorzela, who had burned Tammo's favorite dish—buckwheat groats with cracklings. How it really
was, one could not guess, but the result was visible and unmissable.
After the incident, Stercza could only move—clumsily at that—his left hand and left
foot. His right eyelid was always drooped; from under his left, which he could sometimes
manage to raise, slimy tears constantly flowed, and saliva trickled from the corner
of his lips, contorted into a nightmarish grimace. The incident also caused an almost complete loss of speech,
hence the old man's nickname—Balbulus. The Stutterer-Babbler.
The loss of the ability to speak did not, however, entail what the
entire family had hoped for—loss of contact with the world. Oh, no. The lord of Sterzendorf still
held the clan in his fist and was a terror to all, and what he had to say,
he said. For he always had someone at hand who could understand and translate
his gurgles, croaks, babbling, and shouts into human language. This someone was
usually a child—one of Balbulus's numerous grandchildren or great-grandchildren.
Now the translator was ten-year-old Ofka von Baruth, who, sitting at
the old man's feet, was dressing a doll in scraps of colorful rags.
"So then," Apeczko Stercza finished his story and, clearing his throat,
moved on to the conclusion, "Wolfher, through a messenger, asked to inform you that he will deal with the matter
swiftly. That Reinmar Bielau will be captured on the Wrocław road
and will suffer punishment. Now, however, Wolfher's hands are tied,
because the Duke of Oleśnica is traveling on that road with his entire court and various important ecclesiastical persons, so there is no
way... No way to conduct a pursuit. But Wolfher swears that he will catch Reynevan. That
the honor of the clan can be entrusted to him."
Balbulus's eyelid twitched, a trickle of saliva escaped his lips.
"Bbbhh-bhh-bhh-bhubhu-bhhuaha-rrhhha-phhh- aaa-rrh!" echoed
in the room. "Bbb... hrrrh-urrrhh-bhuuh! Guggu-ggu..."
27

"Wolfher is a fucking idiot," translated Ofka von Baruth in a thin, melodious
voice. "A fool to whom I wouldn't even entrust a bucket of vomit. And the only thing he's capable of catching is his own prick."
"Father..."
"Bbb... brrrh! Bhhrhuu-phr-rrrhhh!"
"Silence," she translated, without raising her head, busy with Ofka's doll. "Listen
to what I say. What I order."
Apeczko patiently waited out the croaks and screeches, and waited for the translation.
"First, Apecz, you shall ascertain," Tammo Stercza commanded through the
girl's mouth, "which woman from Bierutów was entrusted with guarding the Burgundian.
Which one didn't catch on to the true purpose of those charitable excursions to
Oleśnica. Or was in cahoots with the strumpet. Thirty-five lashes with a molded rod for the woman. On her bare arse. Here, before my eyes. Let me at least have that
little bit of joy."
Apeczko Stercza nodded. Balbulus coughed, croaked, and spat all over himself.
Then he contorted his face hideously and cackled.
"As for the Burgundian," translated Ofka, combing the doll's tow hair
with a small card, "whom I already know has taken refuge with the Cistercian nuns of Ligota, I order
her to be extracted from there, even if it means storming the convent. Then lock
the harlot up with monks favorable to us, for example in..."
Tammo abruptly stopped stuttering and gurgling; the rasping died in his throat.
Apeczko, pierced by a bloodshot eye, understood that the old man had noticed his embarrassed expression. That he had caught on. The truth could no longer be hidden.
"The Burgundian," he stammered, "managed to escape from Ligota. Secretly... No one knows where.
Busy with the pursuit... We... didn't keep an eye on her..."
"Interesting," Ofka translated after a long, heavy silence, "interesting,
why this doesn't surprise me at all. But if so, then so be it. I won't
bother my head with the whore. Let Gelfrad deal with this matter when he returns. Let
him deal with the matter himself. His horns don't concern me. It's nothing
new in this family, anyway. I myself must have been well cuckolded. For it cannot be that
such fools were born from my own loins."
Balbulus coughed, croaked, and choked for a few moments. But Ofka did not translate; it was not speech, but an ordinary cough. Finally, the old man rasped, took a breath, contorted his face like a demon, and banged his staff on the floor, after which he gurgled wildly. Ofka listened, putting the end of her braid in her mouth.
"But Niklas," she translated, "was the hope of this clan. My true blood,
the blood of the Sterczas, not some watered-down stuff from God knows what mongrel connections. It cannot be, therefore, that the murderer does not pay for his spilled blood. And with
interest."
Tammo again slammed his staff on the floor. The stick fell from his trembling
hand. The lord of Sterzendorf coughed and sneezed, spitting
and snotting. Standing
28

beside him, Hrozwita von Baruth, Balbulus's daughter, Ofka's mother, wiped his chin,
picked up the staff, and pressed it into his hand.
"Hgrrrhhh! Grhhh... Bbb... bhrr... bhrrrllg..."
"Reinmar Bielau will pay me for Niklas," Ofka translated dispassionately.
"He will pay, God is my witness and all the saints. I'll throw him in the dungeon, in a cage,
in a chest like the one the Głogów people locked Henry the Fat in, with one
hole for food and another for the opposite, so that he can't even scratch himself.
And I'll keep him like that for half a year. And only then will I get to him. And I'll send for
an executioner all the way to Magdeburg, because they have excellent executioners there, not like
these ones here, in Silesia, where the delinquent dies on the second day of torture. Oh no, I'll
bring a master who will dedicate a week to Niklas's murderer. Or two."
Apeczko Stercza swallowed.
"But to be able to do that, the gosling must be caught. And that requires a head.
Reason. Because the gosling is not stupid. A stupid person would not become a bachelor in Prague, would not
insinuate himself into the graces of the Oleśnica monks. And would not have managed to so gracefully
get to Gelfrad's Frenchwoman. Chasing such a clever fellow like
a fool along the Wrocław road, making a laughingstock of oneself, is not enough. Giving the matter publicity,
which will serve the gosling, not us."
Apeczko nodded. Ofka looked at him, twitched her upturned nose.
"The gosling," she continued translating, "has a brother, living on a fief somewhere
near Henryków. It is quite probable that he will seek refuge there. Perhaps
he already has. Another Bielau was, while he lived, a cleric at the Wrocław collegiate church,
so it is not out of the question that the scoundrel will want to take refuge with a scoundrel. I meant to say,
with His Reverence Bishop Konrad. The old drunkard and thief!"
Hrozwita Baruth again wiped the old man's chin, snotty with anger.
"The gosling also has acquaintances among the Brothers of the Holy Spirit in Brzeg. In the hospice. That's
precisely where our clever fellow might have gone, to surprise and mislead Wolfher. Which is not,
by the way, a difficult task. And finally, most importantly, listen up, Apecz.
I'm certain that our gosling will want to play the troubadour, pretend to be some damned Lohengrin
or another Lancelot... He will want to get close to the Frenchwoman. And there, in Ligota,
we will most likely get him, like a dog at a bitch in heat."
"How so, in Ligota?" Apeczko dared to ask. "But she..."
"She escaped, I know. But he doesn't know."
The old fool, thought Apeczko, his soul is even more twisted than his body. But cunning as a fox. And he knows, one must give him credit, a lot. Everything.
"But for what I just said," Ofka translated into human language, "you
are poorly suited, my sons and nephews, blood, supposedly, of my blood
and bone of my bone. Therefore, with all haste, you will go first to Niemodlin, and then
to Ziębice. There... Listen well, Apecz. You will find Kunz Aulock, called
Kyrieleison. And others: Walter de Barby, Sybko of Kobylagłowa, Stork of Gorgo-
29

wic. Tell them that Tammo Stercza pays a thousand Rhenish florins for Reinmar von Bielau, alive. A thousand, remember."
Apeczko swallowed hard at each name. For these were the names of the worst
thugs and murderers in almost all of Silesia, scoundrels without honor or faith.
Ready to murder their own grandmother for three *skojec*, let alone for the fabulous sum of a thousand
guilders. My guilders, thought Apeczko angrily. Because that should be my
inheritance, after this accursed cripple finally kicks the bucket.
"Did you understand, Apecz?"
"Yes, Father."
"Then away, get out of here. Go, on your way, carry out what I have commanded."
First, thought Apeczko, on my way to the kitchen, where I'll eat and drink
for two. You stingy old man. And then we'll see.
"Apecz."
Apeczko Stercza turned. And looked. But not at Balbulus's contorted and bloodshot face, which not for the first time seemed to him, here in Sterzendorf, something unnatural, unnecessary, something out of place. Apeczko
looked into little Ofka's large hazel eyes. At Hrozwita, standing behind the chair.
"Yes, father?"
"Don't fail us."
Or maybe, it flashed through his mind, it's not him at all? Maybe he's no longer here,
maybe a husk is sitting in that chair, a half-corpse, whose brain has already been completely devoured by paralysis? Maybe it's... them? Maybe the women—very young, young, middle-aged, and old
—are ruling Sterzendorf?
He quickly banished this absurd thought from his mind.
"I will not fail. Father."

***

Apeczko Stercza had no intention of hurrying to carry out his orders. He briskly
went, muttering angrily, to the castle kitchen, where he ordered
everything the said kitchen had at its disposal. This included the remains of a deer
haunch, fatty pork ribs, a large coil of blood sausage, a piece of dried
Prague ham, and several pigeons boiled in broth. To this, a whole loaf of bread, large
as a Saracen shield. To this, of course, wines, the best ones, Hungarian
and Moldavian, which Balbulus kept only for his own use. But the paralytic could
be master in his chamber upstairs; outside the chamber, executive power belonged
to someone else. Outside the chamber, Apeczko Stercza was the master.
Apeczko felt like the master and immediately upon entering the kitchen showed that he was.
A dog earned a kick and fled yelping. A cat fled, gracefully avoiding the trajectory
30

of a ladle thrown after it. The serving women practically sat down when an iron pot
crashed onto the stone floor with an indescribable bang. The most sluggish serving woman
got a clout on the neck and learned that she was a whorish good-for-nothing. The servants also learned very various things
about themselves and their mothers, and several became acquainted with the master's fist, hard and heavy as solid iron. The one to whom the order
to bring wines from the master's cellar had to be repeated, received such a kick
that he set off on all fours.
Shortly thereafter, Apeczko—Master Apeczko—sprawled at the table, ate greedily
and in large bites, drank Moldavian and Hungarian wine alternately, threw
bones onto the floor in a lordly manner, spat, belched, and from under his brow eyed
the fat housekeeper, just waiting for her to give him a pretext.
The old gingerbread man, the dotard, the paralytic, makes me call him father, yet he's only
my uncle, my father's brother. But I must endure it. Because when he finally kicks
the bucket, I, the eldest Stercza, will finally become head of the clan. The inheritance,
of course, will have to be divided, but I will be head of the clan. Everyone knows it. Nothing will stop me, nothing can...
Stop me, Apeczko cursed under his breath, this mess with Reynevan and Gelfrad's wife can stop me. A family feud, meaning clashing with the *Landfrieden*, can stop me. Hiring thugs and murderers can stop me. The noisy pursuit, imprisonment in a dungeon, maltreatment and torture of a boy who is a relative
of the Nostitzes and related by marriage to the Piasts. And a vassal of Jan of Ziębice. And the Bishop of Wrocław, Konrad, who loves Balbulus as much as Balbulus loves him, is just waiting
for an opportunity to get at the Sterczas' arses.
Not good, not good, not good.
And all of this, Apeczko suddenly decided, picking his teeth, is Reynevan's fault, Reinmar of Bielawa. And he will pay for it. But not in a way that would stir up all of Silesia.
He will pay simply, quietly, in the dark, with a knife between the ribs.
Then, when—as Balbulus shrewdly guessed—he secretly appears in Ligota,
at the Cistercian convent, under the window of his mistress, Gelfrad's Adela. One
knife thrust, plop into the Cistercian carp pond. And hush. As quiet as a carp.
On the other hand, Balbulus's orders cannot be completely disregarded. If only
for the reason that the Babbler was accustomed to controlling the execution of his
orders. Entrusting their execution not to one, but to several people.
So what to do, by the devil?
Apeczko slammed his knife into the tabletop with a bang, drained his cup in one gulp.
He raised his head, met the gaze of the fat housekeeper.
"What are you staring at?" he snarled.
"The old master," the housekeeper said calmly, "recently brought in
some excellent Italian wine. Shall I have some drawn, noble sir?"
"Indeed," Apeczko smiled despite himself, felt the woman's calmness
transfer to him. "Indeed, please, have some drawn, we shall taste what
has matured in Italy.
31

Send a boy to the watchtower, please, let one who is a good rider and has a head on his shoulders
present himself here on one leg. Someone who can deliver a message."
"As you command, noble sir."

***

Hooves clattered on the bridge; the messenger leaving Sterzendorf looked back,
waved to his woman, who was bidding him farewell from the rampart with a little white kerchief.
And suddenly the messenger caught a movement on the moonlit wall of the watchtower, a shifting,
indistinct shape. What the devil, he thought, what's that crawling there? An eagle-owl? An owl? A bat?
Or perhaps...
The messenger muttered a charm against the evil eye, spat into the moat, and spurred his horse.
The message he carried was urgent. And the master who had entrusted it to him was stern.
He did not see, therefore, how the great wallcreeper spread its wings and, silent as
a ghost, like a nocturnal phantom, soared over the forests to the west, towards the Widawa valley.

***

Sensenberg Castle, as everyone knew, was built by the Templars, and not without reason did they choose this very spot, and no other. The mountain peak, rising above a jagged
precipice, was in ancient times a place of worship for pagan gods; a *kacina* (pagan shrine) stood here,
where, according to legends, the ancient inhabitants of these lands, the Trzebowianie and Bobrzanie, offered human sacrifices to their deities. In times
when only circles of round, moss-covered stones, hidden among weeds, remained
of the *kacina*, the pagan cult continued to spread; Midsummer fires still
burned on the summit. As late as 1189, Bishop Żyrosław of Wrocław threatened severe punishments to those
who dared to celebrate the *festum dyabolicum et maledictum* on Sensenberg. Nearly a hundred years later, Bishop Wawrzyniec still imprisoned those
who celebrated it.
Meanwhile, as mentioned, the Templars arrived. They built their Silesian
castles, menacing and jagged miniatures of Syrian kraks, erected under the supervision
of men with heads wrapped in cloths and faces as dark as tanned bullhide.
It could not have been a coincidence that sacred places of ancient, fading
cults were always chosen for the locations of fortresses—like Mała Oleśnica,
Otmęt, Rogów, Habendorf, Fischbach, Peterwitz, Owiesno, Lipa, Braciszowa
Góra, Srebrna Góra, Kaltenstein. And, of course, Sensenberg.
32

Then, however, the Templars' time came. Justly or not, it's futile to argue,
but an end was made of them, everyone knows how it was. Their castles were taken over
by the Joannites, quickly enriching monasteries and rapidly rising
Silesian magnates scrambled for them. Some, despite the power slumbering
at their roots, fell into ruin with extraordinary speed. Ruins that were avoided, bypassed.
Ruins that were feared.
Not without reason.
Despite rapidly advancing colonization, despite settlers hungry for land pouring in
from Saxony, Thuringia, the Rhineland, and Franconia, Sensenberg mountain and castle
were still surrounded by a wide belt of no-man's-land, a wasteland into which only
a poacher or a fugitive would venture. It was from them, poachers and fugitives, that
tales were first heard of uncanny birds, of nightmarish riders, of lights flickering
in the castle windows, of wild and cruel cries
and songs, of ghostly organ music seeming to emanate from beneath the earth.
There were those who did not believe. There were also those who were lured by the Templar treasure,
supposedly still lying somewhere in the Sensenberg dungeons. There were ordinary curious folk
and restless spirits.
They did not return.

***

That night, if any poacher, fugitive, or adventurer had been in the vicinity of Sensenberg,
the mountain and castle would have given rise to further legends. A storm was approaching from beyond the horizon,
the sky flared every now and then with the light of distant lightning,
so distant that not even the rumble of thunder could be heard. And the black block of the castle against the flashing
sky suddenly blazed with the bright eyes of its windows.
For within the apparent ruin was a large, high-vaulted knights' hall.
The candelabra, chandeliers, and torches burning in iron sconces that illuminated it
drew frescoes from the gloom on the rough walls. The frescoes depicted
knightly and religious scenes. Thus, Percival, kneeling
before the Grail, and Moses, bringing down the stone tablets from Mount Sinai, looked upon the enormous round
table standing in the middle of the hall. Roland in the battle of Albracca and Saint Boniface, dying
a martyr's death by Frisian swords. Godfrey de Bouillon, entering
conquered Jerusalem. And Jesus, falling for the second time beneath the cross. All of them looked
with their somewhat Byzantine eyes at the table and at the knights seated
around it in full armor and hooded cloaks.
Through an open window, a large wallcreeper flew in on a gust of wind.
The bird circled, casting a ghostly shadow on the frescoes, landed, ruffling
its feathers, on the back of one of the chairs. It opened its beak and screeched, and before the screeching
33

had faded, a knight was sitting on the chair, no longer a bird. In a cloak and hood,
twin-like to the others.
"*Adsumus*," the Wallcreeper spoke hollowly. "We are here, Lord, gathered
in Your name. Come to us and be among us."
"*Adsumus*," repeated the knights gathered at the table in one voice. "*Adsumus! Adsumus!*"
The echo ran through the castle like rumbling thunder, like the sound of a distant battle,
like the crash of a battering ram against a fortress gate. And it faded slowly among the dark corridors.
"Glory to the Lord," spoke the Wallcreeper when silence fell. "Near is
the day when all his enemies will lie in dust. Woe to them! That is why we are here!"
"*Adsumus!*"
"Providence," the Wallcreeper raised its head, and its eyes gleamed with the reflected light of a flame, "sends us, my brothers, another opportunity to strike
the Lord's enemies again and once more crush the foes of the faith. The time has come to deliver another blow! Remember, O brothers, this name: Reinmar of Bielawa. Reinmar
of Bielawa, called Reynevan. Listen..."
The hooded knights leaned forward, listening. Jesus, falling
under the cross, looked at them from the fresco, and in his Byzantine eyes was an immensity of very human suffering.

Chapter 3
which discusses things seemingly so little related to each other
as hawking, the Piast dynasty, cabbage with peas,
and the Bohemian heresy. As well as a dispute about whether, to whom, and when one should keep one's word.

Above the Oleśniczka river, winding amidst black alder carr, clumps of white birches, and green meadows, on a rise from which the thatched roofs and smoke of Borowa village were visible, the ducal procession made a longer halt. But not to rest.
Quite the contrary. To tire themselves out. That is, to amuse themselves in a lordly fashion.
As they rode up, flocks of birds rose from the wetlands—ducks, teals,
pochards, pintails, even herons. At this sight, Duke Konrad Kantner, lord of
Oleśnica, Trzebnica, Milicz, Ścinawa, Wołów, and Smogorzewo, and jointly with his brother Konrad the White also of Koźle, immediately ordered the procession to halt
and to be given his favorite falcons. The Duke was almost maniacally fond of hawking.
Oleśnica and its finances could wait, the Bishop of Wrocław could wait,
politics could wait, all of Silesia and the whole world could wait—for
the Duke to see his favorite Raby tear feathers from mallards,
and to convince himself that Srebrny would be valiant in aerial combat with a heron.
The Duke therefore galloped through the reeds and meadows like one possessed, and with him—
equally bravely, though somewhat reluctantly—his eldest daughter Agnieszka, seneschal
Rudiger Haugwitz, and several careerist pages.
The rest of the procession waited at the edge of the forest. Without dismounting, for no one
could know when the Duke would tire of it. The Duke's foreign guest yawned discreetly.
The chaplain muttered—probably a prayer, the chamberlain counted—probably money,
the minnesinger composed—probably rhymes, Princess Agnieszka's ladies-in-waiting
gossiped—probably about other ladies, and the young knights killed boredom by riding around
and exploring the surrounding thickets.
"Ciołek!" (Bull-calf!)

35

Henryk Krompusz reined in his horse and turned it, much surprised, then pricked up his ears, trying
to determine which of the bushes had just quietly called him
by his own familiar nickname.
"Ciołek!"
"Who's there? Show yourself!"
The bushes rustled.
"Saint Hedwig..." Krompusz's jaw dropped in astonishment. "Reynevan? Is that you?"
"No, Saint Hedwig," Reynevan replied in a voice as sour as gooseberries
in May. "Ciołek, I need help... Whose procession is this? Kantner's?"
Before Krompusz, to whom it was finally beginning to sink in, could react, two other
Oleśnica knights joined him.
"Reynevan!" Jaksa of Wisznia groaned. "Christ Almighty, look at you!"
Interesting, thought Reynevan, how you would look if your horse had died just
past Bystre. If you had to wander all night through the bogs and wilderness of
the Świerzna, and then in the morning exchange your wet and muddy rags for a smock filched from a village fence. Interesting, how you would look after something like that,
you preening fop.
The third Oleśnica knight, Benno Ebersbach, who was watching them with a rather grim expression,
probably thought something similar.
"Instead of gawking," he said dryly, "give him some clothes.
Take off those rags, Bielau. Come on, gentlemen, pull out
whatever you have from your saddlebags."
"Reynevan," it was still dawning slowly on Krompusz. "Is that you?"
Reynevan didn't answer. He pulled on the shirt and doublet thrown to him. He was so
angry he was close to tears.
"I need help..." he repeated. "I need it very badly."
"We see and we know," Ebersbach confirmed with a nod. "And we too
are of the opinion that very much so. Very much indeed. Come. You must be shown
to Haugwitz. And to the Duke."
"Does he know?"
"Everyone knows. The matter is widely known."

***

If Konrad Kantner, with his gaunt face, forehead elongated by baldness,
black beard, and piercing monk's eyes, did not much resemble a typical
representative of the dynasty, then in the case of his daughter Agnieszka, there could be no
doubt—this little apple had not fallen far from the Silesian-Masovian
apple tree.
36

The princess had flaxen hair, light eyes, and a small, upturned, cheerful Piast nose, already immortalized by the famous sculpture in Naumburg Cathedral. Agnieszka
Kantnerówna, as Reynevan quickly calculated, was about fifteen years old, so she must
already have been betrothed to someone. Reynevan didn't remember the gossip.
"Stand up."
He stood.
"Know," spoke the Duke, piercing him with a fiery gaze, "that I
do not approve of your deed. Nay, I consider it vile, reprehensible, and culpable. And I sincerely advise you repentance and penance, Reinmar Bielau. My chaplain assures me
that there is a special enclave in hell for adulterers. Demons severely torment
sinners there on the instrument of their sin. I will not go into details out of consideration for the presence
of a young lady."
Seneschal Rudiger Haugwitz snorted angrily. Reynevan remained silent.
"What atonement you will give Gelfrad von Stercza," Kantner continued,
"that is your affair and his. I will not meddle in this matter, especially since you
are both vassals not of mine, but of Duke Jan of Ziębice. And in principle, I should
send you off to Ziębice. Having washed my hands of it."
Reynevan swallowed.
"But," the Duke continued after a moment of dramatic silence, "I am not Pilate,
that's one. Two, out of regard for your father, who laid down his life
at Tannenberg alongside my brother, I will not allow you to be murdered in a foolish family feud. Three, it is generally high time to put an end to family feuds
and live as befits Europeans. That is all. I permit you to travel in my retinue even all the way to Wrocław. But do not show your face to me. For
your sight does not please my eyes."
"Your Ducal..."
"Leave, I said."
The hunt was definitively over. The falcons had their hoods put on, the hunted ducks and herons were tenderizing, tied to the cart's racks, the Duke was pleased, his retinue too, because the chase, which threatened to be long, did not last long at all. Reynevan caught several clearly grateful glances—word had spread through the retinue that it was because of him that the Duke had cut short the hunt and resumed the journey. Reynevan had justified fears that not only that had spread.
His ears burned as if he were being reprimanded.
"Everyone," he grumbled to Benno Ebersbach, riding beside him, "knows everything..."
"Everyone," the Oleśnica knight confirmed, not at all cheerfully. "But, fortunately for you,
not everything."
"Huh?"
"Are you playing the fool, Bielau?" Ebersbach asked, without raising his voice. "Kantner
would surely have driven you away, and perhaps even sent you in fetters to the castellan, if he
37

knew that a corpse had fallen in Oleśnica. Yes, yes, don't stare at me like that. Young
Niklas von Stercza is dead. Gelfrad's horns are Gelfrad's horns, but the Sterczas
will never forgive you for their killed brother."
"With a finger..." Reynevan said after a series of deep breaths. "I didn't even touch
Niklas with a finger. I swear."
"To complete the picture," Ebersbach was visibly unimpressed by the oath, "beautiful
Adela accused you of witchcraft. Of bewitching her and taking advantage of her
when she was helpless."
"Even if that's true," Reynevan replied after a short pause, "she
was forced to do it. Threatened with death. They have her in their hands, after all..."
"They don't," Ebersbach denied. "From the Augustinians, where she publicly
accused you of diabolical practices, beautiful Adela fled to Ligota. Behind the gate
of the Cistercian convent."
Reynevan breathed a sigh of relief.
"I don't believe," he repeated, "those accusations. She loves me. And I love
her."
"Beautifully."
"And you should know, it is beautiful."
"Truly beautiful," Ebersbach looked him in the eyes, "it became, however,
when they searched your workshop."
"Ha. I was afraid of that."
"And rightly so. In my humble opinion, the only reason you don't have the
Inquisition on your tail already is that they haven't finished inventorying the deviltries they found at your place. Kantner might protect you from the Sterczas, but hardly from the Inquisition.
When word of this sorcery spreads, he himself will hand you over to them. Don't go
with us to Wrocław, Reynevan. Break away earlier and flee, hide somewhere.
I'm giving you good advice."
Reynevan didn't answer.
"And by the way," Ebersbach threw out casually. "Do you actually know
magic? Because, you see, I recently met a young lady... Well... How should I put it...
An elixir would come in handy..."
Reynevan didn't answer. A shout came from the head of the procession.
"What is it?"
"Byków," Ciołek Krompusz guessed, urging his horse on. "The 'Under the Gander' Inn."
"And praise be to God," Jaksa of Wisznia added under his breath, "for I'm terribly hungry
after all this damned hunting."
Reynevan, this time too, did not answer. The drawn-out rumbling emanating from his bowels
was more than eloquent.
The "Under the Gander" inn was large and probably well-known, for there were many
guests, both local and travelers, which could be judged by the horses, carts, and the servants and armed men bustling around them. When Duke
38

Kantner's retinue rode into the courtyard with great style and noise, the innkeeper
was already forewarned. He burst out of the entrance like a cannonball, scattering
poultry and splashing dung. He shifted from foot to foot and bowed deeply.
"Welcome, welcome, God be in this house," he panted. "What an honor, what a privilege,
that Your Serene Grace..."
"It's rather crowded here today," Kantner dismounted from the bay held by servants. "Whom are you hosting? Who is emptying the pots here? Will there be enough
for us too?"
"Undoubtedly there will be enough, undoubtedly," the innkeeper assured, struggling to catch
his breath. "And it's not crowded at all anymore... I drove out the rabble, goliards, and peasants...
just as I saw Your Graces on the highway. The main room is quite free
now, the alcove is also free, only..."
"Only what?" Rudiger Haugwitz raised his eyebrows.
"Guests in the room. Important and ecclesiastical persons... Envoys. I dared not..."
"It's good then," Kantner interrupted, "that you didn't dare. You would have shown disrespect to me
and all of Oleśnica if you had dared. Guests are guests! And I am a Piast, not a Saracen
sultan; it's no shame for me to eat together with guests. Lead on, gentlemen."
In the somewhat smoky room, filled with the smell of cabbage, it was indeed not
crowded. In truth, only one table was occupied, at which sat three
men. All had tonsures. Two wore attire characteristic of clergy on a journey, but so rich that they could not have been any ordinary parish priests.
The third wore the habit of a Dominican.
At the sight of Kantner entering, the clergymen rose from the bench. The one whose
attire was richest bowed, but without excessive humility.
"Your Grace, Duke Konrad," he spoke, demonstrating good information, "indeed, it is a great honor for us. I am, with your permission, Maciej Korzbok, official of the Poznań diocese, on a mission to Wrocław, to
Your Ducal Grace's brother, Bishop Konrad, commissioned by His Most Reverend
Lordship Bishop Andrzej Łaskarz. And these are my travel companions, also
journeying from Gniezno to Wrocław: Sir Melchior Barfuss, vicar of His Reverence
Krzysztof Rotenhahn, Bishop of Lubusz. And the Reverend Jan Nejedly
of Vysoké, Prior of the Ordo Praedicatorum, traveling on a mission from the Kraków
provincial of the order."
The Brandenburger and the Dominican bowed their tonsured heads; Konrad Kantner responded
with a slight movement of his head.
"Your Eminence, Your Reverences," he spoke nasally. "It will be a pleasure for me
to dine in such esteemed company. And to converse. And as for conversation, if
it does not weary the reverend gentlemen, we shall have enough both here and on the road, for I too am
journeying to Wrocław, with my daughter... Come here, Anežka... Bow
before the servants of Christ."

39

The princess curtsied, bowed her little head with the intention of kissing his hand, but Maciej Korzbok stopped her, blessed her with a quick sign of the cross over her flaxen
fringe. The Czech Dominican folded his hands, bowed his neck, mumbled a short prayer, adding
something about *clarissima puella*.
"And this," Kantner continued, "is Seneschal Rudiger Haugwitz. And these are my
knights and my guest..."
Reynevan felt a tug on his sleeve. He obeyed Krompusz's gestures and hisses,
and went out with him into the courtyard, where the commotion caused by the Duke's arrival
still continued. Ebersbach was waiting in the courtyard.
"I've made inquiries," he said. "They were here yesterday. Wolfher Stercza, with five others.
I also questioned those Greater Polanders. The Sterczas stopped them, but dared not
impose themselves on ecclesiastical persons. But it's clear they're looking for you along the Wrocław highway.
I'd flee if I were you."
"Kantner," Reynevan mumbled, "will protect me..."
Ebersbach shrugged.
"Your will. And your skin. Wolfher is very loudly and in detail
describing what he'll do to you when he catches you. If I were you..."
"I love Adela and I will not abandon her!" Reynevan burst out. "That's first!
And second... Where on earth would I flee? To Poland? Or perhaps to
Samogitia?"
"Quite a good idea. The one about Samogitia, that is."
"Plague take it!" Reynevan kicked a hen clucking at his feet. "Alright. I'll think.
And I'll come up with something. But first, I'll eat something. I'm dying of hunger, and the smell of this cabbage
is killing me."
It was high time; another moment, and the youths would have gone hungry.
Pots of groats and cabbage with peas, and bowls of pork bones with meat,
were placed on the main table, before the Duke and Princess. The dishes traveled to
the ends of the tables only after the three clergymen seated closest to Kantner,
who, as it turned out, could eat quite a bit, had had their fill. Along the way, to make matters
worse, there was Rudiger Haugwitz, who could eat no less, and the Duke's foreign guest,
a dark-haired knight with shoulders even broader than Haugwitz's, his face so swarthy
as if he had just returned from the Holy Land. Thus, in the bowls that
reached those of lower rank and younger age, almost nothing remained. Fortunately,
a moment later, the innkeeper served the Duke a large platter of capons, which looked
and smelled so delicious that the cabbage and pork fat lost some of their
appeal and reached the ends of the tables in an almost untouched state.
Agnieszka Kantnerówna nibbled at a capon leg with her little teeth, trying to protect
the fashionably slit sleeves of her dress from dripping fat. The men
discussed this and that. It was now the turn of one of the clergymen, that
Dominican, Jan Nejedly of Vysoké.

40

"I am," the aforementioned perorated, "or rather, I was prior at Saint
Clement's in the Old Town of Prague. Item, a master of Charles University.
Now, as you see, I am an exile, dependent on others' charity and bread. My
monastery was plundered, and in the academy, as you can easily guess,
I did not get along with apostates and scoundrels like Jan Příbram, Kristián of Prachatice,
and Jakoubek of Stříbro, may God punish them..."
"We have here," Kantner interjected, catching Reynevan's eye, "one
student from Prague. *Scholarus academiae pragensis, artium baccalaureus*."
"I would advise then," the Dominican's eyes flashed over his spoon, "to
keep a careful watch on him. I am far from making accusations, but heresy
is like soot, like tar. Like dung! Whoever lingers nearby must
get soiled."
Reynevan quickly lowered his head, feeling his ears flush again and blood
rush to his cheeks.
"Nonsense," laughed the Duke, "our scholar has nothing to do with heresy. He's from
a decent family, training to be a priest and a medic at the Prague university. Right,
Reinmar?"
"With your grace's permission," Reynevan swallowed, "I no longer study in Prague.
On my brother's advice, I left Charles University in the year '19, shortly after Saints Abdon and Sennen's Day... That is, right after the defenes... Well, you know when. Now I think
I might try to study in Kraków... Or Leipzig, where most
of the Prague masters fled... I won't return to Bohemia. As long as the unrest continues."
"Unrest!" A few strands of cabbage flew from the excited Czech's mouth and landed on his scapular. "A fine word, indeed! You here, in a peaceful country, cannot even imagine what heresy is doing in Bohemia, what
monstrosities that unfortunate country is witnessing. Incited by heretics, Wycliffites, Waldensians, and other servants of Satan, the rabble has turned its thoughtless fury
against the faith and the Church. In Bohemia, God is being destroyed and His temples burned.
Servants of God are being murdered!"
"News is reaching us," confirmed Melchior Barfuss, vicar of the Bishop of Lubusz, licking his fingers, "truly terrible things. It's hard to believe..."
"And you must believe!" Jan Nejedly shouted even louder. "For no
news is exaggerated!"
Beer splashed from his tankard; Agnieszka Kantnerówna instinctively recoiled,
shielding herself, like a shield, with the capon leg.
"Do you want examples? I can provide them! Massacres of monks in Český Brod and Pomuk, murdered Cistercians in Zbraslav, Velehrad, and Mnichovo
Hradiště, murdered Dominicans in Písek, Benedictines in Kladruby and Postoloprty, murdered innocent Premonstratensian nuns in Chotěšov, murdered priests in Český Brod and Jaroměř, plundered and burned monasteries in Kolín, Milevsko, and Zlatá Koruna, desecrated altars and images of saints
in Břevnov and Vodňany... And what did Žižka do, that rabid dog, that
41

antichrist and spawn of the devil? Bloody massacres in Chomutov and Prachatice, forty
priests burned alive in Beroun, burned monasteries in Sázava and Vilémov,
sacrileges that even a Turk would not commit, heinous crimes and cruelties,
bestialities at the sight of which a Saracen would tremble! Oh, truly, God, how long
will You not judge and avenge our blood?
The silence, in which only the murmur of the Oleśnica chaplain's prayer could be heard,
was broken by the deep and resonant voice of the swarthy-faced and broad-shouldered knight,
Duke Konrad Kantner's guest.
"It didn't have to be this way."
"Pardon?" the Dominican raised his head. "What do you mean by that, sir?"
"All of this could have been easily avoided. It was enough not to burn
Jan Hus in Constance."
"You," the Czech narrowed his eyes, "were already there, then, defending the heretic, shouting, protesting, submitting petitions, I know that. And you were wrong then and you are wrong
now. Heresy spreads like cockle, and Holy Scripture commands that weeds be burned with fire.
Papal bulls command..."
"Leave the bulls," the swarthy man cut him off, "for council debates; they sound ridiculous
quoted in an inn. And in Constance, I was right, you can say what you want.
The Luxembourger guaranteed Hus's safety with his royal word and a letter of safe conduct.
He broke his word and oath, thereby staining monarchical and knightly honor.
I could not look upon that calmly. And I did not want to."
"A knight's oath," Jan Nejedly growled, "is to be made in the service of
God, regardless of who swears it, squire or king. Do you call keeping an oath and word to a heretic divine service? Do you call that honor? I call it sin."
"I, if I give it, give my knightly word in the sight of God. That is why I keep it
even to Turks."
"One may keep one's word to Turks. To heretics, one must not."
"Indeed," said Maciej Korzbok, the Poznań official, very seriously. "A Moor
or a Turk languishes in paganism through ignorance and savagery. He can be converted.
An apostate and schismatic, however, turns away from the faith and the Church,
mocks them, blasphemes. Therefore, he is a hundred times more abhorrent to God. And any means of fighting
heresy is good. Indeed, no one who goes after a wolf or a rabid dog will,
if he is in his right mind, discourse on honor and knightly word! Anything is permissible against a heretic."
"In Kraków," Kantner's guest turned his weathered face towards him, "Canon Jan Elgot,
when a heretic needs to be ensnared, holds the seal of confession for naught. Bishop
Andrzej Łaskarz, whom you serve, recommends the same to the priests of the Poznań diocese.
Anything is permissible. Indeed."
"You don't hide your sympathies, sir," Jan Nejedly of Vysoké said sourly.
"So I will not hide mine either. And I repeat: Hus was a heretic and had to go to the stake."
42

The King of the Romans, Hungary, and Bohemia acted rightly, not keeping his word
given to the Czech heretic.
"And for that," the swarthy man retorted, "the Czechs love him so much now. For that
reason he fled from Vyšehrad with the Bohemian crown under his arm. And now he rules
the Czechs, but in Buda, for they won't let him into Hradčany anytime soon."
"You dare mock King Sigismund," observed Melchior Barfuss.
"And yet you serve him."
"Precisely for that reason."
"Or perhaps for some other reason?" the Czech rasped spitefully. "You,
knight, fought against the Hospitallers of Our Lady at Tannenberg on the
side of the Poles. On Jagiełło's side. The neophyte king, who is the clear
author of the Czech heresy and readily lends an ear to schismatics and Wycliffites. Jagiełło's nephew,
the apostate Korybutowicz, is rampaging in Prague as he pleases, Polish
knights in Bohemia are murdering Catholics and plundering monasteries. And though Jagiełło pretends
it's without his will and consent, he himself somehow doesn't march with an army against the heretics!
And if he did, if he allied himself with King Sigismund in a crusade,
the Hussites would be finished in a flash! So why doesn't Jagiełło do it?"
"Precisely," the swarthy man smiled again, and it was a very significant
smile. "Why? Interesting."
Konrad Kantner cleared his throat loudly. Barfuss pretended to be interested only
in the cabbage with peas. Maciej Korzbok bit his lip, nodded with a grim expression.
"What's true," he admitted, "is true. The Roman King has more than once shown that
he is no friend of the Polish Crown. Truly, every Greater Polander, for I can vouch for them,
will willingly stand up in defense of the faith. But only if
the Luxembourger gives a guarantee that if we march south, then neither the Teutonic Knights
nor the Brandenburgers will invade us. And how can he give such a guarantee,
if he is plotting the partition of Poland with them? Am I not right, Duke Konrad?"
"What's there to discuss," Kantner smiled with exceptional insincerity. "We're
politicizing more than necessary, it seems to me. And politics doesn't go hand in hand with food.
Which is getting cold, by the way."
"Precisely, we must speak of this," Jan Nejedly protested, to the delight
of the younger knights, to whom two pots had already arrived almost untouched by
the talkative nobles. The joy was premature; the nobles showed they could
talk and eat simultaneously.
"For consider, noble sirs," he continued, devouring cabbage, the former prior
of Saint Clement's, "this Wycliffite plague is not just a Czech matter. The Czechs,
I know them, are ready to come here too, as they went to Moravia and Austria. They can come
to you, gentlemen. To all of you, as you sit here."
"Pah," Kantner pursed his lips, digging his spoon into the bowl in search of
cracklings. "I won't believe that."

43

"I even less so," Maciej Korzbok snorted with beer foam. "To us, to
Poznań, they have a bit too far to go."
"To Lubusz and Fürstenwalde," Melchior Barfuss said with a full mouth, "is also quite a distance from Tábor. Oh, I'm not afraid."
"All the more so," added the Duke with an unpleasant smile, "that the Czechs themselves
will sooner receive guests than go to anyone. Especially now that Žižka is gone.
I think guests are to be expected any day now, the Czechs should be looking out for them."
"A crusade? Do you know anything, Your Grace?"
"Not at all," Kantner replied with an expression that suggested the opposite. "I'm
just pondering. Innkeeper! Beer!"
Reynevan quietly slipped out into the courtyard, and from the courtyard behind the pigsty and into the bushes behind the vegetable garden. Having relieved himself properly, he returned. But not to the main room. He went
out the gate, looked for a long time at the highway disappearing into a bluish haze. On which,
to his relief, he did not see the Stercza brothers approaching at a gallop.
Adela, he thought suddenly, Adela is not at all safe with the Cistercian nuns of Ligota.
I should...
I should. But I'm afraid. Of what the Sterczas might do to me. Of what
they describe in detail.
He turned back to the courtyard. He was astonished to see Duke Kantner and Haugwitz
emerging briskly and lightly from behind the pigsties. In principle, he thought, why be
surprised. Even dukes and seneschals go into the bushes behind pigsties. And on foot.
"Lend an ear, Bielau," Kantner said brusquely, washing his hands in a bucket
hastily provided by a serving girl. "And listen to what I say. You
will not go with me to Wrocław."
"Your Ducal..."
"Shut your mouth and don't open it until I order you to. I'm doing this for your
own good, you whelp. Because I am more than certain that in Wrocław my brother the bishop
will throw you in the tower faster than you can say *benedictum nomen Iesu*.
Bishop Konrad is very harsh on adulterers, probably, hehehe, he doesn't like competition, hehehe. So you will take this horse I've lent you and ride to Mała
Oleśnica, to the Joannite commandery. Tell Commander Dytmar de Alzey
that I sent you for penance. There you will sit quietly until I summon you. Clear?
It must be clear. And here's a purse for the road. I know it's small. I would have given more, but
my chamberlain advised against it. This inn has strained my entertainment fund too much."
"Many thanks," Reynevan muttered, though the weight of the little purse by no means
deserved thanks. "Great thanks to Your Grace. It's just that..."
"Don't fear the Sterczas," the Duke interrupted. "They won't find you in the Joannite
house, and you won't be alone on the way there. It so happens that my guest is heading
in that direction, towards Moravia. You probably saw him at the table. He agreed
44

for you to accompany him. Frankly speaking, not right away. But I convinced him. Do you want
to know how?"
Reynevan nodded to indicate that he did.
"I told him that your father died in my brother's banner
at Tannenberg. And he was there too. Only, he says: at Grunwald. Because he was on
the opposing side."
"So then, fare thee well. And cheer up, my boy, cheer up. You cannot
complain of my grace. You have a horse, you have money. And your safety
on the journey is assured."
"How assured?" Reynevan dared to mumble. "Your Grace...
Wolfher Stercza rides with five men... And I... With one knight? Even if
with a squire... Your Grace... That's still only one knight!"
Rudiger Haugwitz snorted. Konrad Kantner pursed his lips condescendingly.
"Oh, you're foolish, Bielau. Supposedly a learned bachelor, yet you didn't recognize a famous man. For that knight, you blockhead, six are a trifle."
And seeing that Reynevan still didn't understand, he explained.
"That is Zawisza Czarny of Garbów."

**Chapter 4**
in which Reynevan and Zawisza Czarny of Garbów discuss this
and that on the Brzeg highway. Then Reynevan cures Zawisza of his gases,
and Zawisza repays him with valuable lessons in recent history.

Slowing his horse somewhat to fall back, the knight Zawisza Czarny of Garbów rose in his saddle and let out a long fart. Then he sighed deeply, leaned both hands on his saddlebow, and farted once more.
“It’s this cabbage,” he explained matter-of-factly, drawing level with Reynevan again. “At my age, one shouldn’t eat so much cabbage. By Saint Stanisław’s bones! When I was young, I could eat, oh ho! A koflik, meaning more than half a pot of cabbage, I’d devour in the time it takes to say three Our Fathers. And it did me no harm. I could eat cabbage in any form, even twice a day, as long as there was plenty of caraway in it. And now, I barely eat a little, and it’s already boiling in my belly, and the gases, you see for yourself, boy, they nearly blow me apart. Old age, damn it, is no joy.”
His horse, a powerful black stallion, bucked heavily, as if eager to charge. The stallion, right up to its nostrils, was covered in a black caparison adorned at the withers with Sulima, the knight’s coat of arms. Reynevan was surprised he hadn’t immediately associated the famous sign—untypical in Polish heraldry, both in terms of its honorable figure and its charges.
“Why so silent?” Zawisza suddenly addressed him. “We ride and ride, and if you’ve uttered ten words, that’s all. And that’s when prodded. Are you sulking at me? Is it about Grunwald, eh? You know what, boy? I could assure you that I cannot be the one who killed your father. It would be no effort for me to say that I couldn’t have met your father in battle, because the Cracow banner was in the center of the Polish-Lithuanian formation, and Konrad the White’s banner was on the Teutonic left wing, beyond Stębark. But I won’t say it, because it would be a lie. Then, on the day of the Dispersion of the Apostles, I killed many men. In total confusion and a hellish turmoil, where little could be seen. Because it was a battle. And that’s that.”
“My father,” Reynevan cleared his throat, “bore on his shield…”
“I don’t remember coats of arms,” the Sulimczyk interrupted sharply and rather bluntly. “In a pitched battle, they mean nothing to me. What’s important is which way the horse’s head is turned. If it’s in the opposite direction to mine, I strike, even if he had the Mother of God herself on his shield. Besides, when blood sticks to dust, and dust to blood, you can’t see shit on the shields anyway. I repeat, Grunwald was a battle. And in battle, as in battle. Let’s leave it at that. Don’t sulk at me.”
“And I’m not sulking.”
Zawisza reined in his stallion slightly, rose in his saddle, and farted. Startled jackdaws flew up from the roadside willows. The knight of Garbów’s retinue, riding behind, consisting of a grizzled squire and four armed retainers, prudently kept their distance. Both the squire and the retainers rode fine horses and were well and cleanly dressed. As befitted the servants of someone who was the starosta of Kruszwica and Spiš and who drew, as rumor had it, revenues from, conservatively speaking, thirty villages. Neither the squire nor the retainers, however, looked like silken court pages. On the contrary, they looked like sturdy ruffians, and the weapons they were festooned with could by no means be considered ceremonial ornaments.
“So,” Zawisza continued, “you’re not sulking. Why then are you so silent?”
“Because it seems to me,” Reynevan dared, “that you are more sulking at me. And I know why.”
Zawisza Czarny turned in his saddle and looked at him for a long time.
“Well, now,” he finally spoke, “wronged innocence has spoken in a pitiful voice. Know, sonny, that it is not proper to defile other men’s wives. And if you want my opinion, it is a vile practice. And worthy of punishment. Frankly, in my eyes, you’re no better than one who cuts purses in a crowd or robs chicken coops. Well, I think, one petty scoundrel or another, a miserable rogue, who managed to take advantage of an opportunity.”
Reynevan did not comment.
“Centuries ago in Poland,” Zawisza Czarny continued, “there was a custom that a caught lover of other men’s wives was led to a bridge, and to that bridge his sack with eggs was nailed with an iron spike. And a knife was laid beside him. There, if you want freedom, cut yourself loose.”
Reynevan did not comment this time either.
“They don’t nail them anymore,” the knight concluded. “A pity. You wouldn’t call my lady Barbara flighty, but when I think that some gallant, some smooth-faced fellow like you, boy, might be taking advantage of her moment of weakness there in Cracow… Ach, what’s there to talk about.”
The silence that fell for a few moments was once again broken by the cabbage eaten by the knight.
“Yeees,” Zawisza groaned with relief and looked at the sky. “Know, however, boy, that I do not condemn you, for only he who is without sin should cast stones. And having thus summarized, let us speak no more of it.”
“Love is a great thing, and it has many names,” said Reynevan, somewhat puffed up. “Listening to songs and romances, no one marvels at Tristan and Isolde, at Lancelot and Guinevere, or at the troubadour Guilhem de Cabestaing and Lady Margaret of Roussillon. And Adela and I are united by no less great, ardent, and sincere love. And yet, everyone seems to have conspired against us…”
“If this love is so great,” Zawisza feigned interest, “why then are you not with your beloved? Why *fugas chrustas*, truly like a caught petty thief? Tristan, to be with Isolde, found a way, disguised himself, if memory serves, in the rags of a scabby beggar. Lancelot, to save his Guinevere, single-handedly attacked all the Knights of the Round Table.”
“It’s not that simple,” Reynevan blushed like kermes. “Much good it will do her if they catch me and kill me. Not to mention myself. But I will find a way, don’t you worry. Even in disguise, like Tristan. Love always conquers. *Amor vincit omnia*.”
Zawisza rose in his saddle and farted. It was hard to tell if it was a comment or just the cabbage.
“One good thing from this dispute,” he said, “is that we’ve talked, because it was getting tedious riding in silence, with our noses down. Let’s talk more, young Silesian sir. On a neutral topic.”
“Why,” Reynevan ventured after a moment, “are you traveling this way? Isn’t it closer from Cracow to Moravia through Racibórz? And the Opava region?”
“Perhaps it is closer,” Zawisza agreed. “But you see, I can’t stand the Racibórz folk. The recently deceased Duke Jan, may the Lord shine upon his soul, was a real son of a bitch. He sent murderers after Przemek, son of Duke Noszak of Cieszyn, and I knew Noszak, and Przemko was my friend. So I didn’t avail myself of Racibórz hospitality then, nor will I now, because Jan’s little son, Mikołajek, is bravely, so they say, following in his parent’s footsteps. Besides, I took a detour because there was something to discuss with Kantner in Oleśnica, to repeat to him what Jagiełło had said about him. Moreover, the road through Lower Silesia is usually full of attractions. Though I see that opinion is somewhat exaggerated.”
“Ha!” Reynevan guessed shrewdly. “That’s why you’re riding in full armor! And on a warhorse! You’re looking for a fight. Am I right?”
“You are right,” Zawisza Czarny admitted calmly. “They said this place of yours is teeming with robber knights.”
“Not here. It’s safe here. That’s why it’s so crowded.”
Indeed, they could not complain about a lack of company. They themselves had not overtaken anyone, and no one had overtaken them, but in the opposite direction, from Brzeg towards Oleśnica, the traffic was lively. They had already passed several merchants with heavily laden wagons, drawing deep ruts, escorted by a dozen armed men with exceptionally thuggish faces. They passed a column of tar-makers on foot, laden with kegs, announced earlier by a pungent smell of resin. They passed a group of mounted Teutonic Knights of the Star, they passed a young Joannite with the face of a cherub, traveling with a squire, they passed drovers herding oxen, and also five suspicious-looking pilgrims who, though they politely asked the way to Częstochowa, did not cease to be suspicious in Reynevan’s eyes. They passed goliards riding in a rickety wagon, singing *In cratere meo*, a song set to the words of Hugh of Orléans, in merry and not entirely sober voices. And just now—a knight with a lady and a small retinue. The knight was in splendid Bavarian armor, and the rampant, two-tailed lion on his shield proved his belonging to the extensive Unruh family. The knight—it was clear to see—instantly recognized Zawisza’s coat of arms and greeted him with a nod, but so proud as to make it clear that the Unruhs were no worse than the Sulimczyks. The knight’s companion, dressed in a light purple gown, rode sidesaddle on a beautiful dark bay mare and wore—surprisingly—no head covering; the wind played freely in her golden hair. Riding past, the woman raised her head, smiled faintly, and bestowed upon Reynevan, who was gaping at her, a gaze so green and eloquent that the boy shivered.
“Oh,” Zawisza said after a moment. “You will not die a natural death, little boy.”
And he farted. With the force of a medium-caliber bombard.
“To prove,” said Reynevan, “that I’m not at all cross with you for your malice and gibes, I shall cure you of these bloats and gases.”
“Curious how.”
“You shall see. If only we come across a shepherd.”
A shepherd appeared rather quickly, but upon seeing the horsemen turning towards him from the highway, he bolted in panic, plunged into the thicket, and vanished like a golden dream. Only the bleating sheep remained.
“We should have,” Zawisza assessed, standing in his stirrups, “taken him by stealth, from an ambush. Because now we won’t catch him in these rough grounds. Judging by the pace at which he fled, he has already managed to put the Odra between us and him.”
“Or even the Nysa,” added Wojciech, the knight’s squire, demonstrating a lively wit and knowledge of geography.
Reynevan, however, paid no heed to the mockery. He dismounted, walked with a sure step to the shepherd’s hut, from which he emerged a moment later with a large bunch of dried herbs.
“It’s not the shepherd I need,” he explained calmly, “but this. And a little boiling water. Is there a pot to be found?”
“Everything,” said Wojciech drily, “can be found.”
“If there’s cooking involved,” Zawisza looked at the sky, “then we’ll make a stop. And a longer one, for night is near.”

***

Zawisza Czarny settled more comfortably on his sheepskin-covered saddle, glanced into the recently emptied cup, and sniffed it.
“Truly,” he declared, “it tastes like sun-warmed ditch water, and stinks of cat. But it helps, by the Lord’s Passion, it helps! After the first cup, when it purged me, I felt better, and now it’s as if it’s been taken away by hand. My compliments, Reinmar. It’s a lie, as I see, that universities can only teach a young man drunkenness, debauchery, and foul language. A lie, truly.”
“A smidgen of knowledge about herbs, nothing more,” Reynevan replied modestly. “What really helped you, Sir Zawisza, was taking off your armor, resting in a more comfortable position than the saddle…”
“You’re too modest,” the knight interrupted. “I know my capabilities, I know how long I can endure in the saddle and armor. You should know that I often travel by night, with a lantern, without stopping. Firstly, it shortens the journey, and secondly, because then, if not by day, perhaps at least in the dark someone will accost me… And provide some amusement. But since you claim this is a peaceful area, ha, why tire the horses, let’s sit by the fire until dawn, let’s chat… After all, that’s entertainment too. Maybe not as good as gutting a few robber knights, but still.”
The fire crackled cheerfully, illuminating the night. Fat sizzled and smelled, dripping from sausages and pieces of bacon roasted on sticks by squire Wojciech and the retainers. Wojciech and the retainers maintained silence and a respectful distance, but gratitude could be seen in the glances they cast at Reynevan. They evidently did not share their master’s fondness for all-night travel with a lantern.
The sky above the forest glittered with stars. The night was cool.
“Yeees,” Zawisza massaged his stomach with both hands. “It helped, it helped, better and faster than the usually recommended prayers to Saint Erasmus, patron of the bowels. What magical herb was that, what enchanted mandrake? And why did you seek it specifically from a shepherd?”
“After Saint John’s Day,” explained Reynevan, glad for the chance to show off, “shepherds gather various herbs known only to them. They first carry the bundle tied to a *hyrkawica*, as the shepherd’s staff is called in Czech. Then the herbs are dried in the hut. And a decoction is brewed from them, which…”
“Which is given to the flock to drink,” the Sulimczyk calmly interjected. “Meaning, you treated me like a bloated cow. Well, but if it helped…”
“Don’t be angry, Sir Zawisza. Folk wisdom is immense. None of the great physicians and alchemists disdained it, neither Pliny, nor Galen, nor Walafrid Strabo, nor the learned Arabs, nor Gerbert of Aurillac, nor Albertus Magnus. Medicine has benefited greatly from the common people, and especially from shepherds. For they possess great and immeasurable knowledge of herbs and their healing powers. And of… other powers.”
“Indeed?”
“Indeed,” confirmed Reynevan, moving closer to the fire for a better view. “You wouldn’t believe, Sir Zawisza, how much power is hidden in this bundle, in this dry wisp from a shepherd’s hut, for which no one would give a broken shilling. Look: chamomile, water lily, seemingly nothing special, but when you brew an infusion, they work wonders. Likewise those I gave you: meadowsweet, hogweed, angelica. And these, here, are called ‘sporzyczek’ and ‘siedmikraska’ in Czech. Few physicians know how effective they are. And with a decoction of those called ‘jakubki,’ shepherds sprinkle their sheep in May, on the day of Saints Philip and James, for protection against wolves. Believe it or not, a wolf will not touch sprinkled sheep. These are Saint Wendelin’s berries, and this is Saint Linhart’s herb; both saints, as you probably know, are patrons of shepherds, alongside Martin. When giving these herbs to the flock, one must invoke these very saints.”
“What you were muttering over the cauldron was not about saints.”
“It was not,” admitted Reynevan, clearing his throat. “I told you, folk wisdom…”
“Such wisdom smells strongly of the stake,” said the Sulimczyk gravely. “If I were you, I’d be careful whom I treat. Whom I talk to. And in whose presence I invoke Gerbert of Aurillac. I’d be careful, Reinmar.”
“I am careful.”
“And I,” spoke up squire Wojciech, “think that if there is magic, it’s better to know about it than not to know. I think…”
He fell silent, seeing Zawisza’s threatening gaze.
“And I think,” said the knight of Garbów sharply, “that all the evil in this world comes from thinking. Especially when done by people entirely lacking the predisposition for it.”
Wojciech bent even lower over the harness he was cleaning and greasing. Reynevan waited a longer moment before speaking.
“Sir Zawisza?”
“Hm?”
“In the inn, in the dispute with that Dominican, you didn’t hide… Well… That as if… You are for the Czech Hussites. Or at least more for than against.”
“And what, did thinking immediately associate you with heresy?”
“That too,” Reynevan admitted after a moment. “But I’m even more curious…”
“What are you curious about?”
“How it was… How it was at Německý Brod, in the year twenty-two? When you were taken into Czech captivity? Because legends are already circulating…”
“What kind of legends?”
“Well, that the Hussites captured you because escape seemed unworthy to you, and you couldn’t fight, being an envoy.”
“Is that what they say?”
“Yes. And also, that… That King Sigismund abandoned you in your need. And himself fled ignominiously.”
Zawisza was silent for a moment.
“And you,” he finally spoke, “would like to know the true version, eh?”
“If,” Reynevan replied hesitantly, “it doesn’t bother you…”
“And why should it bother me? Time passes more pleasantly with a chat. Why then not chat?”
Contrary to his declaration, the knight of Garbów was silent again for a long time, playing with the empty cup. Reynevan was not sure if he was waiting for his questions, but he was in no hurry to ask them. As it turned out, rightly so.
“To begin,” Zawisza began, “it seems to me, we must start at the beginning. Which is that King Władysław sent me to the Roman King on a rather delicate mission… it concerned a marriage with Queen Euphemia, Sigismund’s sister-in-law, widow of Wenceslaus of Bohemia. As is now known, nothing came of it, Jagiełło preferred Sonya Holszańska, but at that time it was not known. King Władysław instructed me to settle with the Luxembourger what was necessary, mainly the dowry. So I went. But not to Požun or Buda, but to Moravia, from where Sigismund was just setting out on another crusade against his disobedient subjects, with the firm intention of capturing Prague and finally eradicating the Hussite heresy in Bohemia.”
“When I arrived there, and I reached it on Saint Martin’s Day, Sigismund’s crusade was developing quite nicely. Although the Luxembourger’s army was somewhat weakened. Most of the Lusatian army, led by Landvogt Rumpold, had already managed to go home, contenting themselves with devastating the lands around Chrudim. The Silesian contingent had returned home, in which, incidentally, was our recent host and table companion, Duke Konrad Kantner. So, in the march on Prague, the king was effectively supported only by Albrecht’s Austrian knighthood and the Moravian army of the Bishop of Olomouc. Well, but Sigismund had more than ten thousand Hungarian cavalry alone…”
Zawisza fell silent for a moment, gazing at the crackling fire.
“Willy-nilly,” he continued, “I had to, in order to negotiate Jagiełło’s marriage with the Luxembourger, take part in their crusade. And observe various things. Very various. Such as, for example, the capture of Polička and the massacre committed after its capture.”
The retainers and the squire sat motionless; who knows, perhaps they were even asleep. Zawisza spoke in a quiet and rather monotonous voice. Sleep-inducing. Especially for someone who probably knew the story. Or had even participated in the events.
“After Polička, Sigismund marched on Kutná Hora. Žižka blocked his way, repelled several attacks by the Hungarian cavalry, but when news broke that the town had been taken by treason, he retreated. The royal forces entered Kutná Hora, intoxicated with triumph… Ha, ha, they had defeated Žižka himself, Žižka himself had fled before them! And then the Luxembourger made an unforgivable mistake. Although I advised him against it, as did Filip Scollari…”
“You mean, Pippo Spano? That famous Florentine condottiero?”
“Don’t interrupt, boy. Against Pippo’s advice and mine, King Sigismund, convinced that the Czechs had fled in panic and would not stop until Prague, allowed the Hungarians to disperse throughout the surrounding area to, as he called it, seek winter quarters, because the frost was severe. So the Magyars scattered and spent Christmas plundering, raping women, burning villages, and murdering those whom they considered heretics or their sympathizers. That is, anyone who came their way.”
“At night, glows lit up the sky, by day, smoke, and the king feasted in Kutná Hora and held court. And then, on Epiphany, in the morning, news broke: Žižka is coming. Žižka had not fled, he had only retreated, regrouped, strengthened, and was now marching on Kutná Hora with the full force of Tabor and Prague, he was already in Kaňk, he was already in Nebovidy! And what? What did the valiant crusaders do upon this news? Seeing that there was no time to gather the army scattered around the area, they fled, leaving behind a lot of equipment and belongings, setting fire to the city behind them. Pippo Spano momentarily controlled the panic and formed a line halfway between Kutná Hora and Německý Brod.”
“The frost had eased, it was cloudy, gray, wet. And then, from afar, we heard… And we saw… Boy, I had never heard or seen anything like it before, and I have heard and seen much. They were marching towards us, they, the Taborites and Praguers, marching, carrying banners and monstrances, in a beautiful, even, disciplined formation, with singing thundering like thunder. Their infamous wagons were coming, from which cannons, howitzers, and *tarasnice* grinned at us…”
“And then the conceited German *helden*, Albrecht’s proud Austrian men-at-arms, the Magyars, the Moravian and Lusatian nobility, Spano’s mercenaries, all as one man, took to flight. Yes, boy, you didn’t mishear: before the Hussites came within firing range, Sigismund’s entire army was fleeing in total disarray, in wild panic, head over heels, towards Německý Brod. Knighted knights fled, trampling and knocking each other over, screaming in fear, before the Prague cobblers and rope-makers, before peasants in bast shoes, whom they had so recently mocked. They fled in panic and terror, throwing away weapons which, during this entire crusade, they had raised mainly against the defenseless. They fled, boy, before my astonished eyes, like cowards, like rascals caught by an orchardist stealing plums. As if they were frightened of… the truth. The motto VERITAS VINCIT, embroidered on the Hussite banners.”
“The Hungarians and the iron lords mostly managed to escape to the left bank of the frozen Sázava. Then the ice broke. I advise you, boy, with all my heart, if you ever have to fight in winter, never flee across ice in armor. Never.”
Reynevan promised himself he never would. The Sulimczyk panted, cleared his throat.
“As I was saying,” he continued, “the knighthood, though it lost its honor, saved its skin. Mostly. But the common foot soldiers, hundreds of spearmen, archers, pavisiers, mercenary soldiers from Austria and Moravia, armed burghers from Olomouc, these the Hussites caught and beat, beat terribly, beat for two miles, from the village of Habry to the outskirts of Německý Brod. And the snow on that road turned red.”
“And you? How were you…”
“I did not flee with the royal knighthood, nor did I flee then, when Pippo Spano and Jan von Hardegg fled, and they, to give them their due, fled as some of the last and not without a fight. I too, contrary to fables, fought, and fought hard. Envoy or not, one had to fight. And I didn’t fight alone, there were a few Poles with me and a good few Moravian squires. Those who didn’t like to flee, especially through icy water. So we fought, and I’ll tell you this much, many a Czech mother weeps there because of me. But *nec Hercules*…”
The retainers, as it turned out, were not asleep. For one had just jumped as if bitten by a viper, another cried out in a strangled voice, a third grated his sword as he drew it. Squire Wojciech snatched up his crossbow. A sharp voice and imperious gesture from Zawisza calmed them all.
Something emerged from the darkness.
At first, they thought it was a fragment, a clump of darkness, even darker than darkness itself, budded from the impenetrable gloom, marking itself with anthracite blackness in the night’s flickering darkness, brightened by flashes from the fire. When the flame flared more violently, more vividly and brightly, this piece of darkness, losing none of its blackness, nevertheless took shape. And form. A small, squat, paunchy form, the form of neither a bird ruffling its feathers, nor a beast with bristling fur. The creature’s head, drawn into its shoulders, was adorned with a pair of large, pointed ears, sticking up, like a cat’s, vertically and motionless.
Wojciech slowly, without taking his eyes off the creature, put down his crossbow. One of the retainers invoked the intercession of Saint Kinga, but he too was silenced by Zawisza’s gesture, a gesture not violent, but full of power and authority.
“Welcome, stranger,” spoke the knight of Garbów, his composure impressive. “Sit by our fire without fear.”
The creature moved its head; Reynevan caught a fleeting glint of large eyes in which the fire was reflected redly.
“Sit here without fear,” Zawisza repeated, his voice both kind and firm. “You need not fear us.”
“I do not fear,” the creature rasped. To everyone’s astonishment.
The creature then extended a paw. Reynevan would have jumped back, but he was too afraid to move. And suddenly, with amazement, he realized that the paw was pointing to the coat of arms on Zawisza’s shield. Then, to his even greater astonishment, the creature pointed to the cauldron with the herbal infusion.
“Sulima and the Herbalist,” the creature croaked. “Righteousness and knowledge. What then is there to fear? I do not fear. My name is Hans Mein Igel.”
“Welcome to us, Hans Mein Igel. Are you hungry? Or thirsty?”
“No. Just to sit. To listen. For he heard them speaking. And came to listen.”
“You are our guest.”
The creature approached the fire, bristled into a ball, and became motionless.
“Yeees,” Zawisza once again impressed with his composure. “Where was I?”
“On that…” Reynevan swallowed, regained his speech. “On that, *nec Hercules*.”
“Just so,” rasped Hans Mein Igel.
“Well,” said the Sulimczyk casually, “so it was. *Nec Hercules*, they overcame us. There were a lot of them, Hussites, I mean. And we were lucky that the Utraquist cavalry fell upon us, for the Taborite flail-men know no such words as ‘pardon’ or ‘ransom.’ When they finally unhorsed me, someone who remained with me, Mertwicz or Rarowski, managed to shout out who I was. That I had been at Grunwald with Žižka and Jan Sokol of Lamberk.”
Reynevan sighed quietly, hearing the famous names. Zawisza was silent for a long time.
“The rest,” he said at last, “you must know. For the rest cannot differ much from the legend.”
Reynevan and Hans Mein Igel nodded silently. It was a long time before the knight spoke again.
“Now,” he said, “it seems to me that in my old age I’ve earned myself a curse or something. Because when I was ransomed from captivity and returned to Cracow, all that I saw then, on Epiphany, at Německý Brod, all that I looked at the next day, after the capture of the city, I told King Władysław. I told him. I didn’t advise, I didn’t push my opinion, I wasn’t importunate in my judgments and assessments. I simply told him, and he, the cunning old Lithuanian, listened. And he knew. And never, boy, be sure of this, even if the Pope shed tears over the threatened faith, and the Luxembourger raged and threatened, the cunning old Lithuanian will not send Polish and Lithuanian knighthood against the Czechs. And not at all out of spite for the Luxembourger for the Wrocław sentence or for the partition schemes in Požun, but because of my story. And the only correct conclusion drawn from it, that Polish and Lithuanian knighthood is needed against the Teutonic Knights and it would be foolish, completely senseless, to drown it in the Sázava, Vltava, or Elbe. Jagiełło, after hearing my story, will never join the anti-Hussite crusades. Due to my doing, as it was said. That’s why I’m going to the Danube, against the Turks, before they excommunicate me.”
“You’re joking,” Reynevan stammered. “Where you… What excommunication? A knight like you… You must be joking.”
“Surely,” Zawisza nodded. “Surely I am. But there is fear.”
They were silent for some time. Hans Mein Igel panted quietly. The horses in the darkness snorted restlessly.
“Would this be,” Reynevan ventured, “the end of knighthood? And chivalry? Infantry, united and compact, shoulder to shoulder, not only able to withstand mounted men-at-arms, but even defeat them? The Scots at Bannockburn, the Flemings at Courtrai, the Swiss at Sempach and Morgarten, the English at Agincourt, the Czechs at Vítkov Hill and Vyšehrad, at Sudoměř and Německý Brod… Maybe this is the end… of an era? Maybe the time of knighthood is ending?”
“War without knighthood and chivalry,” Zawisza Czarny replied after a moment, “must eventually degenerate into mere murder. And consequently, genocide. I would not want to take part in something like that. But it will not happen so quickly, so I don’t think I’ll live to see it. Between us, I wouldn’t want to live to see it.”
A long silence reigned. The fire was dying down, the embers glowed ruby-red, from time to time erupting in a bluish flame or a geyser of sparks. One of the retainers snored. Zawisza rubbed his forehead with his hand. Hans Mein Igel, black as a clump of darkness, twitched his ears. When his eyes once again reflected the flame, Reynevan realized that the creature was looking at him.
“Love,” Hans Mein Igel suddenly spoke, “has many names. And for you, young Herbalist, it is she who will determine your fate. Love. She will save your life when you don’t even know it is her. For the Goddess has many names. And even more faces.”
Reynevan was silent, dumbfounded. The one who reacted was Zawisza.
“Well, well,” he said. “A prophecy. Like any, hard to understand, like any, it fits everything and nothing at the same time. No offense, Sir Hans. And for me? Will you have something?”
Hans Mein Igel moved his head and ears.
“By a great river,” he said at last in his not very clear, hoarse voice, “on a hill stands a castle. On a hill, and water flows around it. And it is called: Golubac. A bad place. Do not go there, Sulima. A bad place for you, Golubac. Do not go there. Turn back.”
Zawisza was silent for a long time, clearly lost in thought. He was silent for so long that Reynevan thought he would dismiss the strange words of the strange night creature with silence. He was mistaken.
“I,” Zawisza broke the silence, “am a man of the iron sword. I know what awaits me. I know my fate. I have known it for almost forty years, from the moment I took a sword in my hand. But I will not look back. I will not look at the *hundsfelds*, dog graves, and royal betrayals left behind my horse, at the baseness, at the meanness and impiety of spirit. I will not turn back from my chosen path, good Sir Hans Mein Igel.”
Hans Mein Igel said not a word, but his large eyes gleamed.
“Nevertheless,” Zawisza Czarny rubbed his forehead, “I would prefer it if, like for Reynevan, you prophesied love for me. Not death.”
“Me too,” said Hans Mein Igel, “I would prefer it. Farewell.”
The creature suddenly grew larger, its fur bristled intensely. And it disappeared. It dissolved into the darkness, the same darkness from which it had emerged.

***

The horses snorted and pawed the ground in the darkness. The retainers snored. The sky was brightening, stars paling above the treetops.
“Incredible,” Reynevan finally said. “That was incredible.”
The Sulimczyk jerked his head up, awakened from a doze.
“What? What’s incredible?”
“That… Hans Mein Igel. You know, Sir Zawisza, that… Well, I must admit… I was full of admiration for you.”
“Why?”
“When he emerged from the gloom, you didn’t even flinch. Nay, your voice didn’t even tremble. And how you talked to him later, it was admirable… And yet it was… A night creature. Non-human… An alien.”
Zawisza Czarny of Garbów looked at him for a long time.
“I know plenty of people…” he replied at last in a very serious voice. “A whole lot of people more alien to me.”

***

The dawn was misty, wet; droplets of dew hung like whole garlands on cobwebs. The forest was quiet, but menacing like a sleeping beast. The horses shied away from the approaching, creeping mist, snorted, shook their heads.
Beyond the forest, at a crossroads, stood a stone cross. One of the numerous monuments to crime in Silesia. And to deeply belated remorse.
“Here we part,” said Reynevan.
The Sulimczyk looked at him, refraining, however, from comment.
“Here we part,” the boy repeated. “Like you, I too have no taste for looking back at *hundsfelds*. Like you, the thought of baseness and meanness of spirit is repugnant to me. I am returning to Adela. For… No matter what that Hans said… My place is with her. I will not flee like a coward, like a petty thief. I will face what I must face. As you faced it at Německý Brod. Farewell, noble Sir Zawisza.”
“Farewell, Reinmar of Bielawa. Take care of yourself.”
“And you too. Who knows, maybe we’ll see each other again someday.”
Zawisza Czarny of Garbów looked at him for a long time.
“I don’t think so,” he said at last.

**Chapter 5**
in which Reynevan first learns firsthand how a hunted wolf feels in a surrounded forest. Then he meets Nikoletta the Fair-haired. And then he drifts downstream.

Beyond the forest, at a crossroads, stood a stone penitential cross. One of the numerous monuments to crime in Silesia. And to deeply belated remorse.
The cross had arms ending in the shape of trefoils. On its base, widened at the bottom, an axe was carved—the tool with which the penitent had dispatched his neighbor to the next world. Or a few neighbors.
Reynevan examined the cross more closely. And swore very ugly.
It was exactly the same cross where, a good three hours ago, he had bid farewell to Zawisza.
The fog was to blame, which since dawn had been drifting like smoke over fields and forests; the drizzle was to blame, which with fine drops had lashed his eyes, and when it stopped, had intensified the fog even more. Reynevan himself was to blame, his fatigue and lack of sleep, his distraction caused by constant thoughts of Adela de Stercza and plans for her liberation. And besides, who knows? Perhaps the real culprits were the numerous mamunas, zwodnicas, lesoviks, mayki, kobolds, sprites, will-o'-the-wisps, and other mischievous spirits specializing in leading people astray, which inhabited the Silesian forests? Less amiable and less benevolent relatives and acquaintances of Hans Mein Igel, whom he had met during the night?
However, looking for culprits made no sense, and Reynevan knew this all too well. It was necessary to assess the situation rationally, make a decision, and act according to the latter. He dismounted, leaned against the penitential cross, and began to think intensely.
Instead of being somewhere halfway to Bierutów after three hours of riding, he had been riding in circles all morning and was still where he had started, that is, in the vicinity of Brzeg, no more than a mile from the town.
Or perhaps, he thought, perhaps fate guided me? Gave me a hint? Perhaps I should take advantage of being close, go to the city, to the friendly Hospital of the Holy Spirit, ask for help there? Or is it better not to waste time and, according to the original plan, ride straight to Bierutów, to Ligota? To Adela?
Cities should be avoided, he concluded after some thought. His good, even friendly, contacts with the Brzeg Hospitallers were known to everyone, and therefore also to the Sterczas. Moreover, the road to the Joannite commandery in Mała Oleśnica, the place where Duke Konrad Kantner wanted to seclude him, led through Brzeg. Leaving aside the duke’s generally good intentions, and leaving aside the fact that Reynevan had absolutely no desire to spend several years in penance with the Joannites, someone from Kantner’s retinue could have blabbed or been bribed, and then it was probable that the Sterczas were lurking at the Brzeg tollgates.
So, Adela, he thought, I’m going to Adela. To Adela’s rescue. Like Tristan to Isolde, like Lancelot to Guinevere, like Gareth to Lyonors, like Guinglain to Esmeralda, like Palmerin to Polinarda, like Medoro to Angelica. In short, a bit foolishly and a bit riskily, nay, madly, straight into the lion’s jaw. But, firstly, this might surprise the pursuit, they might not expect it. Secondly, Adela is in need, waiting, and surely longing; I cannot let her wait.
He brightened up, and with him, as if by Merlin’s wand, the sky began to brighten. It was still misty and wet, but the sun could already be felt, something up there was slowly brightening, and the omnipresent grayness began to take on colors. The birds, hitherto gloomily silent, began to chirp timidly, and finally chirped for good. The drops on the cobwebs glistened like silver. And the roads leading from the crossroads, shrouded in mist, looked like some fabulous netherworlds.
And there is also a way not to succumb to misleading charms. Angry that he had been too conceited and hadn’t thought of it earlier, Reynevan pushed aside with his foot the weeds growing around the base of the cross, and walked along the edge of the road. Quickly and without difficulty, he found what he was looking for. Feathery meadow caraway, pink-flowered eyebright, spurge. He stripped the stems of their leaves, put them together. It took a moment before he remembered how and on which fingers to wind them, how to intertwine them, how to make the *nodus*, the knot. And how the spell sounded.
One, two, three
*Wolfsmilch, Kümmel, Zahntrost*
*Binde zu samene*
*Semitae eorum incurvatae sunt*
And my road is straight.
After a moment, one of the crossroads became brighter, more pleasant, inviting. Interestingly, without the help of the charm, Reynevan would never have guessed that this was the right one. But Reynevan knew that charms do not lie.

***

He had been riding for perhaps the time it takes to say three Our Fathers when he heard a dog barking and the loud, excited honking of geese. Shortly thereafter, the smell of smoke pleasantly tickled his nostrils. The smoke of a smokehouse, in which, beyond any doubt, something very tasty was hanging. Perhaps ham. Perhaps bacon. Or perhaps a smoked goose breast. Reynevan sniffed the aroma so intently that he forgot about the world and, not even knowing how or when, rode into the enclosure and onto the yard of a roadside inn.
The dog barked at him, but more out of duty; the gander, stretching its neck, hissed at the horse’s pasterns. The smell of smoked meat was joined by the smell of baking bread, which stood out even above the stench of a large dung heap, besieged by geese and ducks.
Reynevan dismounted, tied his gray horse to a post. The stable boy, who was grooming horses nearby, didn’t even pay attention to him, he was so busy. Reynevan’s attention, however, was drawn to something else—on one of the porch posts, on rather haphazardly tangled multicolored threads, hung a hex: three twigs tied in a triangle and entwined with a wreath of wilted trefoils and marsh marigolds. Reynevan pondered, but wasn’t particularly surprised. Magic was ubiquitous; people used magical attributes without even knowing what they meant or what they were really for. What was significant, however, was the fact that the hex, protecting from evil, though probably shoddily made, could have confused his charm.
That’s why I ended up here, he thought. Damn it. But well, since I’m already here…
He entered, ducking his head under the low beam of the doorframe.
The membranes in the small windows barely let in light; inside, it was semi-dark, brightened only by flashes of fire from the chimney. A cauldron hung over the fire, occasionally frothing over, to which the fire reacted with a hiss and smoke, further hampering visibility. There weren’t many guests; only at one of the tables, in the corner, sat four men, probably peasants; it was hard to make them out in the gloom.
Reynevan had barely sat down on the bench when a wench in an apron placed a bowl before him. Though at first he intended only to buy bread and ride on, he refrained from protesting—the *prażuchy* (roasted flour dumplings) in the bowl smelled deliciously and irresistibly of melted bacon fat. He placed a groschen on the table—one of the few received from Kantner.
The wench bent slightly, handing him a linden-wood spoon. A faint scent of herbs wafted from her.
“You’ve fallen in like a plum into a pile of dung,” she muttered quietly. “Sit still. They’ve already seen you. They’ll jump you the moment you move from the table. So sit and don’t budge.”
She walked towards the hearth, stirred the steaming and sputtering cauldron. Reynevan sat petrified, staring at the cracklings on the dumplings. His eyes had already adjusted to the gloom. Enough to see that the four men at the table in the corner had too many weapons and armor on them to be peasants. And that all four were watching him attentively.
He silently cursed his foolishness.
The wench returned.
“There are too few of us left in this world,” she muttered, pretending to wipe the table, “for me to let you perish, sonny.”
She paused her hand, and Reynevan saw on her little finger a marsh marigold, similar to those in the hex on the post. Tied with its stem in such a way that the yellow flower formed a kind of ring jewel. Reynevan sighed, instinctively touched his own charm, the knotted and tucked-under-a-doublet-button stems of spurge, eyebright, and caraway. The wench’s eyes blazed in the semi-darkness. She nodded.
“I saw it the moment you walked in,” she whispered. “And I knew those ones were hunting for you. But I won’t let you perish. There are too few of us left; if we don’t help each other, we’ll be wiped out completely. Eat, don’t let on.”
He ate very slowly, feeling shivers run down his spine under the gaze of the men from the corner. The wench clattered a pan, called something back to someone in the other room, added wood to the fire, returned. With a broom.
“I had them,” she muttered, sweeping, “take your horse to the threshing floor, behind the pigsty. When it starts, run through that door, at the back, behind the rush mat. Mind your step beyond the threshold. For this.”
Still pretending to clean, she picked up a long straw, surreptitiously but quickly tied three knots in it.
“Don’t worry about me,” she whispered, dispelling his scruples. “No one will pay attention to me.”
“Gerda!” shouted the innkeeper. “The bread needs to be taken out! Move it, you slattern!”
The wench walked away. Hunched, drab, nondescript. No one paid her any attention. No one except Reynevan, to whom she cast a parting glance that blazed like a torch.
The four from the table in the corner stirred, stood up. They approached, spurs jingling, leather creaking, mail shirts clanking, fists resting on the hilts of swords, short swords, and baselards. Reynevan once again, this time more forcefully, cursed his lack of sense in his thoughts.
“Sir Reinmar Bielau. Well, boys, you see for yourselves what hunting experience means. The beast skillfully tracked, the thicket skillfully surrounded, just a bit of luck, and one isn’t without a catch. And luck has truly smiled upon us today.”
Two of the types stood on either side, one to the right, the other to the left. The third took up a position behind Reynevan. The fourth, the one who had spoken, mustachioed, dressed in a brigandine densely studded with bosses, stood opposite. Then, without waiting for an invitation, he sat down.
“You won’t,” he didn’t ask, rather stated, “struggle, cause any fuss, or any hullabaloo? Eh? Bielawa?”
Reynevan didn’t answer. He held the spoon between his lips and the rim of the bowl, as if he didn’t know what to do with it.
“You won’t,” the mustachioed type in the brigandine assured himself. “Because you surely know that would be quite foolish. We have nothing against you, just another ordinary job. But we, you understand, are accustomed to making our work easier. If you start kicking and making noise, we’ll make you docile, lickety-split. Here, on the edge of this table, we’ll break your arm. It’s a tried and tested method; after such a procedure, you don’t even need to tie the patient. Did you say something, or did I imagine it?”
“Nothing,” Reynevan overcame the resistance of his numb lips, “I said nothing.”
“That’s good. Finish your food. It’s a ways to Sterzendorf, why should you ride hungry.”
“Especially,” drawled the type on the right, in mail and iron vambraces, “since in Sterzendorf they probably won’t feed you right away.”
“And even if they do,” snorted the one from behind, unseen, “it probably won’t be what you fancy.”
“If you let me go… I’ll pay you…” Reynevan forced out. “I’ll pay you more than the Sterczas are giving.”
“You insult professionals,” said the mustachioed man in the brigandine. “I am Kunz Aulock, called Kyrieleison. I can be bought, but not bribed. Gulp down your dumplings. Lickety-split!”
Reynevan ate. The *prażuchy* had lost their taste. Kunz Aulock—Kyrieleison—tucked the mace he had been holding into his belt and pulled on his gauntlets.
“You shouldn’t have,” he said, “messed with another man’s woman.”
“Quite recently,” he added, not having received an answer, “I heard a priest, quoting drunk from some letter, perhaps to the Hebrews. It went like this: every transgression will receive its just reward, *iustam mercedis retributionem*. In plain terms, it means that if you’ve done something, you must know the consequences of your actions and be ready to bear them. You must be able to accept it with dignity. For example, look to your right. This is Sir Stork of Gorgowice. Being of similar inclinations as you, quite recently, together with his companions, he committed an act upon a certain Opole townswoman for which, if caught, they tear with pincers and break on the wheel. And what? Look and admire how Sir Stork bears his fate with dignity, how clear his countenance and gaze are. Take his example.”
“Take his example,” croaked Sir Stork, who, incidentally, had a pimply face and a bleary gaze. “And get up. Time to go.”
At that moment, the chimney hearth exploded, spewing fire, a cloud of sparks, and billows of smoke and soot into the room with a terrible bang. The cauldron flew out as if shot, crashed to the floor, and splashed its boiling contents. Kyrieleison jumped, and Reynevan, with a strong shove, toppled the table onto him. He kicked the bench back, and with the unfinished bowl of *prażuchy*, he smacked Sir Stork right in his pockmarked face. And he dived like a pike towards the door to the threshing floor. One of the types managed to grab him by the collar, but Reynevan had studied in Prague; he’d been grabbed by the collar in almost every tavern in the Old Town and Lesser Town. He twisted, struck with his elbow until something crunched, broke free, and jumped through the door. He remembered the warning, nimbly sidestepped the knotted straw lying just beyond the threshold.
Kyrieleison, pursuing him, naturally knew nothing of the magic straw and promptly fell flat on his face on the threshold, sliding with momentum through pig dung. Immediately after, Stork of Gorgowice tripped over the charm, and a third ruffian fell on top of Stork, who was cursing a blue streak. Reynevan was already in the saddle of the waiting horse, already spurring it into a gallop, straight ahead, cross-country through gardens, over cabbage patches, through gooseberry hedges. The wind whistled in his ears; behind him, he heard curses and the squealing of pigs.
He was among the willows by a drained fishpond when he heard the thud of hooves and shouts of pursuit from behind. Instead of going around the pond, therefore, he galloped along the very narrow causeway. His heart stopped several times as the causeway crumbled under the hooves. But he made it.
The pursuit also charged onto the causeway, but they weren't so lucky. The first horse didn't even make it halfway; it stumbled with a whinny and sank belly-deep in the mud. The second horse shied, completely tearing up the causeway with its horseshoes, and slid rump-first into the sticky mire. The riders screamed, cursing furiously. Reynevan realized he had to take advantage of the circumstance and the time it afforded him. He spurred his gray with his heel, went into a gallop across the heathlands, towards the wooded hills, beyond which he expected the saving forests.
Though aware of the risk, he forced his heavily panting horse into a strenuous gallop up the slope. At the top, too, he gave the gray no rest, immediately urging it through the groves covering the hillside. And then, quite unexpectedly, a rider blocked his path.
The startled gray reared, whinnying piercingly. Reynevan stayed in the saddle.
"Not bad," said the rider. Or rather, the amazon. For it was a girl.
Quite tall, in men's attire, in a tight velvet doublet, from under which a snow-white ruff of a shirt peeked out at the neck. With a thick, fair braid falling onto her shoulder from under a sable kolpak, adorned with a tuft of heron feathers and a gold brooch with a sapphire, probably worth as much as a good steed.
"Who's chasing you?" she shouted, skillfully controlling her dancing horse. "The law? Speak up, now!"
"I am not a criminal..."
"Then for what?"
"For love."
"Ha! I thought so at once. See that row of dark trees? The Stobrawa flows there. Ride there as fast as you can and hide in the marshes on the left bank. And I'll draw them away from you. Give me your cloak."
"What are you saying, milady... How can this be..."
"Give me your cloak, I said! You ride well, but I ride better. Oh, what an adventure! Oh, what a tale this will be to tell! Elżbieta and Anka will writhe with envy!"
"Milady..." Reynevan stammered. "I cannot... What will happen if they catch you?"
"They? Catch me?" she snorted, narrowing her eyes, blue as turquoises. "You must be joking!"
Her mare, coincidentally also gray, tossed its graceful head, danced again. Reynevan was forced to agree with the strange maiden. That noble steed, at first glance a racer, was worth much more than the sapphire brooch on her kolpak.
"This is madness," he said, throwing her his cloak. "But thank you. I will repay you..."
From the bottom of the hill, the shouts of the pursuit could be heard.
"Don't waste time!" shouted the maiden, pulling the hood over her head. "Onwards! There, to the Stobrawa!"
"Milady... Your name... Tell me..."
"Nikoletta. My Alkasyn, pursued for love! Fareweeeell!"
She spurred her mare into a gallop, and it was more like flight than a gallop. She descended the slope like a hurricane, in a cloud of dust, showed herself to the pursuit, and rode across the heathlands at such a mad pace that Reynevan instantly rid himself of remorse. He understood that the fair-haired amazon risked nothing. Kyrieleison's, Stork's, and the others' heavy horses, carrying two-hundred-pound men, could not compete with the full-blooded gray mare, additionally burdened only by a light girl and a light saddle. And indeed, the maiden didn't even let herself be chased within sight; she very quickly disappeared behind the hill. But the pursuit followed her, stubbornly and relentlessly.
They might tire her out with a steady run, Reynevan thought with fear. Her and that mare of hers. But, his conscience reassured him, she surely has her retinue somewhere nearby. On such a horse, so dressed, it's obvious that she's a high-born girl; girls like her don't ride alone, he thought, galloping in the direction indicated by the maiden.
And obviously, he thought, swallowing the wind at a gallop, her name isn't Nikoletta at all. She made fun of me, poor Alkasyn.

***

Hidden among the alder carr marshes by the Stobrawa, Reynevan caught his breath, nay, even felt proud and defiant, truly like Roland or Ogier, who had outwitted and led astray the pursuing hordes of Moors. His defiance and good mood, however, deserted him when he met with a completely unchivalrous adventure, when something happened to him that, if one believed the ballads, never happened to Roland, Ogier, Astolfo, Renaud de Montauban, or Raoul de Cambrai.
Quite simply and entirely prosaically, his horse went lame.
Reynevan dismounted immediately when he felt the false, broken rhythm of the steed’s gait. He examined the gray’s leg and horseshoe, but could ascertain nothing. Nor, for that matter, could he do anything. He could only walk, leading the limping animal by the reins. Beautiful, he thought. From Wednesday to Friday, one horse ridden to death, another lamed. Beautiful. Not a bad result.
To make matters worse, from the right, high bank of the Stobrawa, whistles, whinnies, curses suddenly resounded, shouted in the familiar voice of Kunz Aulock, called Kyrieleison. Reynevan pulled the horse into the densest bushes, grabbed its muzzle to prevent it from whinnying. The shouts and curses died away in the distance.
They ran the girl down, he thought, and his heart sank to his belly, as much from fear as from remorse. They caught her.
They didn’t catch her, they didn’t run her down, reason calmed him. They caught up, but at most with her retinue, where they realized their mistake. Where "Nikoletta" laughed at them and mocked them, safe among her knights and retainers.
So they returned, they are circling, tracking. Hunters.

***

He spent the night in the thicket, teeth chattering, swatting at mosquitoes. Without closing an eye. Or perhaps closing them, but only for a tiny moment. He must have fallen asleep, he must have dreamed, for how else could he have seen the girl from the inn, the gray, unnoticed by anyone, the one with the marsh marigold ring on her finger? How else, if not as a dream vision, could she have come to him?
*So few of us are left,* said the girl, *so few. Don’t let yourself be caught, don’t let yourself be tracked. What leaves no trace? A bird in the air, a fish in the water.*
A bird in the air, a fish in the water.
He wanted to ask her who she was, where she knew the charms from, what—for surely not gunpowder—had caused the chimney explosion. He wanted to ask her many things.
He didn’t manage. He woke up.

***

Before dawn, he set off. He followed the course of the little river. He walked for perhaps an hour, keeping to the high riverbanks, when suddenly a wide river stretched out below him. As wide as only one in all of Silesia.
The Odra.

***

A small barge sailed up the Odra against the current, as graceful in the stream as a grebe deftly gliding along the edge of a bright shallow. Reynevan watched greedily.
So cunning you are, he thought, watching the wind fill the barge’s sail and the water foam before its bow. Such hunters you are? Sir Kyrieleison et consortes? You think you’ve tracked me so well, having surrounded the thicket? Just wait, I’ll play a trick on you. I’ll break through, I’ll slip out of your encirclement so gracefully, with such dash, that you’ll eat the devil before you find my trail again. Because you’ll have to look for that trail near Wrocław.
A bird in the air, a fish in the water…
He pulled the gray towards the well-worn road leading to the Odra. To be sure, however, he didn’t walk along the road, but kept to the osiers and willows. The road, as he supposed, marked the direction towards a river landing. He judged well.
Even from a distance, he heard the raised voices of people at the landing, agitated, whether in argument or in the heat of bargaining and trade negotiations, it was unclear. It was easy, however, to recognize the language they spoke. And they spoke Polish.
So, before he emerged from the osiers and saw the landing from the escarpment, Reynevan knew to whom belonged both the voices and the small scows, barges, and boats moored to the piles. They were Wasserpolen, Water Poles, Odra raftsmen and fishermen, an association organized more like a clan than a guild, a *maszoperia*, united not only by their profession but also by their language and a strong sense of national distinctiveness. The Water Poles controlled a large part of Silesian fishing, had a significant share in timber rafting, and an even more significant one in small river transport, where they competed quite successfully with the Hanseatic League. The Hansa did not reach higher up the Odra than Wrocław; the Water Poles carried goods as far as Racibórz. Down the Odra, they sailed as far as Frankfurt, Lubusz, and Kostrzyn, and even—in some incomprehensible way bypassing the strict Frankfurt staple right—further down, beyond the mouth of the Warta.
The landing reeked of fish, mud, and tar.
Reynevan, with difficulty, led the limping horse down the slippery clay escarpment, approached the landing, walking between sheds, huts, and drying nets. Bare feet thudded and slapped on the jetty; loading and unloading were in progress. One scow was being unloaded, another loaded. Part of the cargo, consisting mainly of tanned hides and small barrels of unknown content, was being moved from the landing to wagons; a bearded merchant supervised the operation. A bull was being led onto one of the scows. The bull roared and stamped until the whole jetty shook. The raftsmen cursed in Polish.
It quieted down rather quickly. The wagons with hides and barrels drove off; the bull tried to damage the tight pen in which it was enclosed with its horn. The Water Poles, according to their custom, got into an argument. Reynevan knew enough Polish to understand that it was an argument about nothing.
“Does anyone among you, if I may ask, sail downriver? To Wrocław?”
The Water Poles interrupted their dispute and looked at Reynevan with not particularly friendly eyes. One spat into the water.
“And even if,” he grunted, “so what? Your noble lordship?”
“My horse has gone lame. And I need to get to Wrocław.”
The Pole snorted, hawked, spat again.
“Well,” Reynevan didn’t give up. “So how will it be?”
“I don’t transport Germans.”
“I am not German. I am Silesian.”
“Aha?”
“Aha.”
“Then say: *soczewica, koło, miele, młyn* (lentils, wheel, grinds, mill).”
“*Soczewica, koło, miele, młyn*. And you say: *stół z powyłamywanymi nogami* (a table with broken legs).”
“*Stół z powy… myła… wały…* Get on.”
Reynevan didn’t need to be told twice, but the boatman bluntly cooled his enthusiasm.
“Hold on! Where? Firstly, I’m only sailing to Oława. Secondly, it costs five *skojec* coins. For the horse, an additional five.”
“If you don’t have it,” interjected a second Wasserpolak with a foxy smile, seeing Reynevan fumbling in his purse with a grim face, “then I’ll buy that horse. For five… Well, let’s say six *skojec*. Twelve groschen. You’ll have just enough for the trip. And for the horse, not having it, you won’t have to pay. Pure profit.”
“This horse,” Reynevan noted, “is worth at least five *grzywna*.”
“This horse,” the Pole noted shrewdly, “is worth shit. Because you won’t get where you’re in a hurry to go on him. So how will it be? Will you sell?”
“If you add another three *skojec* for the saddle and tack.”
“One *skojec*.”
“Two.”
“Agreed.”
The horse and money changed owners. Reynevan, in farewell, patted the gray on the neck, stroked its mane, sniffed, saying goodbye, after all, to a friend and companion in misfortune. He grabbed a rope and jumped aboard. The boatman cast off the mooring line from the pile. The scow lurched, slowly entered the current. The bull roared, the fish stank. On the jetty, the Water Poles were examining the gray’s leg and arguing about nothing.
The scow sailed downriver. Towards Oława. The gray water of the Odra gurgled and foamed at its sides.

***

“Sir.”
“What?” Reynevan started, rubbed his eyes. “What is it, skipper?”
“Oława ahead.”
From the mouth of the Stobrawa to Oława, it is less than five miles by the Odra. A scow sailing with the current can cover such a distance in no more than ten hours. Provided that one sails without long stops and has no other occupations besides sailing.
The Wasserpolak, skipper of the scow, had countless occupations. Reynevan also could not complain about a lack of stops along the way. Generally speaking, however, he had no reason to complain. Although instead of ten hours, he spent a day and a half and two nights on the scow, he was relatively safe, traveled comfortably, rested, slept soundly, and ate his fill. Nay, he even conversed.
The Water Pole—though he did not tell Reynevan his name and did not require to be told—was, all in all, quite a likeable and pleasant fellow. Though taciturn, not to say gruff, he was by no means surly or rude. Though simple, he was by no means stupid. The scow tacked between clumps of reeds and shallows, calling at landings now on the left, now on the right bank. The four-man crew bustled about as if scalded; the skipper cursed and urged them on. The helm was confidently held by the Wasserpolak’s wife, a woman considerably younger than him. Reynevan, not to overstep the bounds of courtesy, avoided, if possible, looking at her strong thighs visible from under her tucked-up skirt. He averted his gaze, if he could, when, during maneuvers with the steering oar, her shirt strained over breasts worthy of Venus.
On the scow, Reynevan visited Odra landings with names such as Jazica, Zagwiździe, Kłęby, and Mat; he witnessed collective fishing and commercial transactions, as well as matchmaking. He saw the loading and unloading of various goods. He saw things he had never seen before, such as a catfish measuring five cubits and weighing one hundred and twenty-five pounds. He ate what he had never eaten before, such as fillets of that catfish roasted over embers. He learned how to protect himself from a *utopiec* (drowner), *niks* (nixie), and *wirnik* (whirlpool spirit). What the difference is between a dragnet and a trammel net, between a weir and a fish trap, between an oxbow lake and a sandbar, and between a bream and a *guściora* (a type of fish). He heard many ugly words about the German lords who oppressed the Water Poles with rapacious tolls, duties, and taxes.
And the next morning, it turned out to be Sunday. The Water Poles and local fishermen did not work. They prayed for a long time before rather crudely made statues of the Virgin Mary and Saint Peter, then feasted, then held something like a local assembly, and then got drunk and fought.
Thus, though long, the journey did not drag at all. And now it was dawn, or rather morning. And the town of Oława beyond the river bend. The Wasserpolak’s wife leaned on the helm, her breasts pressed against her shirt.
“In Oława,” the skipper spoke, “various matters will take me one, at most two days. If you can manage to wait that long, I’ll take you to Wrocław, young Silesian sir. Without additional charge.”
“Thank you,” Reynevan extended his hand for a handshake, aware that he had just been honored with a show of sympathy. “Thank you, but on the way, there was time to think over a few things. And now Oława suits me even better than Wrocław.”
“As you wish. I’ll set you down wherever you want. Do you prefer the left bank, or the right?”
“I’d like to get to the Strzelin road.”
“Then on the left. I also understand that you’d rather avoid the town tollgate itself?”
“I would prefer,” Reynevan admitted, astonished by the Pole’s astuteness. “If it’s no trouble for you.”
“What trouble could it be for me. Helm to port, Maryśka. Sail towards Drozdowy Jaz.”
Beyond Drozdowy Jaz stretched an extensive oxbow lake, entirely covered with a carpet of yellow-flowering water lilies. Mist drifted over the oxbow lake. Distant sounds of the already awakened Oława outskirts could be heard—the crowing of roosters, barking of dogs, the clanging of metal on metal, a small bell.
At a given signal, Reynevan jumped onto the rickety jetty. The scow scraped against the piles, pushed aside the waterweeds with its bow, and lazily turned back into the current.
“Follow the causeway all the way,” called the Wasserpolak. “And so that the sun is at your back! All the way to the bridge over the Oława, then towards the forest. There’ll be a stream, and beyond it, the Strzelin highway. You can’t get lost!”
“Thank you! Godspeed!”
Mist quickly began to rise from the river; the scow started to disappear. Reynevan slung his bundle over his shoulder.
“Sir Silesian!” came a call from the river.
“Yes?”
“*Stół z powyłamywanymi nogami*!”




**Chapter 6**
in which Reynevan first gets a beating, and then sets off for Strzelin in the company of four people and one dog. The boredom of the journey is enlivened by a dispute about heresies, which supposedly foam up like cockle.

At the edge of the forest, amidst green bistorts, a stream flowed merrily, its sunlit water meandering along a path marked by a line of willows. There, where a clearing began and the road entered the forest, the stream's banks were spanned by a small bridge of thick logs, logs so black, mossy, and old, as if the structure had been built in the time of Henryk the Pious. On the bridge stood a traveler's wagon, hitched to a bay, rather scrawny nag. The wagon was tilted sharply. It was easy to see why.
"A wheel," Reynevan stated the fact, approaching. "There's trouble, eh?"
"Bigger than you think," she replied, smearing tar on her sweaty forehead, a young, red-haired, and pretty, though somewhat stout, woman. "Our axle-pin broke."
"Ha. Then you can't move without a blacksmith."
"Oh, oh!" The second traveler, a bearded Jew in modest but neat and by no means poor attire, clutched his fox-fur cap. "God of Isaac! Misfortune! Woe! What then are we to do?"
"You were traveling," Reynevan guessed from the direction the wagon tongue pointed, "to Strzelin?"
"You guessed right, young sir."
"I'll help you, and you'll give me a ride in return. I, you see, am also heading that way. And I too have troubles..."
"It's not hard to figure out," the Jew moved his beard, and his eyes gleamed slyly. "That you're a nobleman, young sir, that's clear. So where then is your horse? You intend to travel by cart, though you are clearly no Lancelot? But never mind. You have an honest face. I am Hiram ben Eliezer, rabbi of the Brzeg kahal. On my way to Strzelin..."

72
"And I am," the red-haired woman merrily interjected, imitating the Jew's manner of speaking, "Dorota Faber. On my way into the wide world. And you, young sir?"
"My name," Reynevan decided after a brief moment of hesitation, "is Reinmar Bielau. Listen. We'll do this. We'll somehow get the wagon off the bridge, unhitch the mare, I'll ride her bareback to the Oława outskirts, with that axle-pin, to the blacksmith. If need be, I'll bring him back. Let's get to work."
It turned out not to be so easy.
Dorota Faber was of little help, the elderly rabbi of none. Though the scrawny mare stubbornly beat her hooves against the rotten logs and strained against the horse collar, they moved the wagon barely a fathom. Reynevan couldn't lift the vehicle by himself. They finally sat down by the broken axle and watched, panting, the gudgeons and lampreys, which made the sandy bottom of the little river teem.
"You said," Reynevan asked the redhead, "that you're going out into the world. Where to?"
"To earn my bread," she replied freely, wiping her nose with the back of her hand. "For now, since the Jewish gentleman kindly took me on his wagon, with him to Strzelin, then, who knows, perhaps even to Wrocław itself. In my trade, I'll find work anywhere, but I'd like the best..."
"In your... trade?" Reynevan began to connect the dots. "That... that means... that..."
"Exactly. I am... How do you say it... That, well... A public sinner. Until recently, from the 'Under the Crown' brothel in Brzeg."
"I understand," Reynevan nodded gravely. "And you were traveling together? Rabbi? You? You took... Hmm... A courtesan on your wagon?"
"Why shouldn't I have taken her?" Rabbi Hiram's eyes widened. "I took her. Indeed, young sir, I'd have come off as a terrible churl if I hadn't taken her."
The mossy logs creaked under footsteps.
"Trouble?" asked one of the three men who had stepped onto the bridge. "Can we help?"
"It would be welcome," Reynevan admitted, though the unpleasant faces and shifty little eyes of the eager helpers did not appeal to him at all. It turned out he was right. As soon as the wagon, pushed by many pairs of strong hands, found itself on the meadow beyond the bridge.
"Well now!" said the tallest of the types, overgrown with hair up to his eyes, shaking a cudgel. "Job's done, now it's time to pay. Unhitch the horse from the wagon, you scurvy dog, take off your fur coat, hand over your purse. You, young master, take off your doublet and step out of your boots. And you, pretty one, step out of everything, you'll pay in a different way. On your knees!"
His comrades guffawed, baring rotten teeth. Reynevan bent down and picked up the wheel he had used to lever the wagon.
"Look at him," the hairy one pointed at him with the cudgel, "what a combative young master. Life hasn't taught him yet that when they tell you to give up your boots, you have to give them up. Because you can walk barefoot, but not on broken legs. Heigh-ho! Beat him!"
73
The types nimbly dodged the whistling windmill of blows with which Reynevan surrounded himself. One got behind him and, with a practiced kick to the knee, knocked the boy to the ground, then howled and staggered, shielding his eyes from the nails of Dorota Faber, who was sitting on his neck. Reynevan was hit across the shoulder with a cudgel, curled up under kicks and blows from sticks, saw one of the types fell the Jew, who was trying to intervene, with a punch. And then he saw a devil.
The thugs started screaming. Terribly.
What got to the thugs was not, of course, any devil. It was a large, pitch-black dog, a mastiff, wearing a spiked collar on its neck. The dog writhed among the thugs like black lightning, attacking not like a mastiff, but like a wolf. It bit with its fangs and released. To bite another. In the calves. In the thighs. In the crotches. And when they fell, in their hands and faces. The screams of those bitten became macabrely thin. It made one's hair stand on end.
A piercing, modulated whistle sounded. The black mastiff immediately jumped away from the thugs, sat motionless with ears pricked. Like a figure of anthracite.
A rider entered the bridge. Dressed in a short grey cloak fastened with a silver clasp, a tight-fitting wams, and a chaperon with a long tail draped over his shoulder.
"When the sun peeks over the top of that spruce tree," the newcomer spoke resonantly, straightening his by no means portly figure on a black stallion, "I'll set Beelzebub on your trail, you scoundrels. That's how much time you have, you gallows-birds. And since Beelzebub is swift, I advise running. And I advise against breaks in your run."
The gallows-birds didn't need to be told twice. They fled into the forest, limping, groaning, and looking back fearfully. Beelzebub, as if he knew what would frighten them more, looked not at them, but at the sun and the top of the spruce.
The rider lightly urged his stallion forward. He rode closer, looking down from his saddle at the Jew, Dorota Faber, and Reynevan, who was just getting up, feeling his ribs and wiping blood from his nose. The rider, as the boy did not fail to notice, observed Reynevan with particular attention.
"Well, well," he said at last. "A classic situation. Like in a fairy tale. A swamp, a bridge, a wheel, trouble. And help as if by magic. You didn't summon it, did you? Aren't you afraid I'll take out and make you sign pacts with the devil?"
"No," said the rabbi. "Wrong fairy tale."
The rider snorted.
"I am Urban Horn," he announced, still looking directly at Reynevan. "Whom did I and my Beelzebub assist?"
"Rabbi Hiram ben Eliezer of Brzeg."
"Dorota Faber."
"Lancelot of the Cart," Reynevan, despite everything, still didn't quite trust him.
Urban Horn snorted again, shrugged his shoulders.
74
"I trust you are heading towards Strzelin. I overtook a traveler on the highway, heading there as well. If you'll allow me to advise, it would be better to ask for a ride than to stand here over a broken wheel until nightfall. Better. And safer."
Rabbi Hiram ben Eliezer cast a longing glance at his vehicle, but by nodding his beard, he conceded the stranger's point.
"And now," the stranger looked over the forest, at the top of the spruce, "farewell. Duty calls."
"I thought," Reynevan dared, "you were only scaring them..."
The rider looked him in the eyes, and his gaze was cold. Icy, in fact.
"I was scaring them," he admitted. "But I, Lancelot, never make idle threats."

***

The traveler announced by Urban Horn turned out to be a priest. A portly man with a deeply shaven tonsure, dressed in a cloak trimmed with polecat fur, driving a large wagon.
The priest stopped his horse, listened to the story without getting down from the driver's seat, examined the wagon with the broken axle, carefully observed each of the three humbly begging individuals, and finally understood what the beggars were begging for.
"What do you mean?" he finally asked with great disbelief. "To Strzelin? On my wagon?"
The supplicants adopted even more supplicating postures.
"I, Filip Granciszek of Oława, pastor of Our Lady of Consolation, a good Christian and Catholic clergyman, am to take a Jew onto my cart? A whore? And a vagrant?"
Reynevan, Dorota Faber, and Rabbi Hiram ben Eliezer looked at each other, their expressions grim.
"Get in," the priest finally announced dryly. "Indeed, I'd come off as a terrible churl if I didn't take you."

***

Not an hour had passed when Beelzebub, glistening with dew, appeared before the dun gelding pulling the priest's wagon. And a little later, Urban Horn appeared on the highway on his black horse.
75
"I'll ride with you to Strzelin," he announced casually. "If, of course, you have no objection."
No one had any objection.
No one asked about the fate of the gallows-birds. And from Beelzebub's wise eyes, nothing could be read.
Or everything.

***

And so they rode along the Strzelin highway, through the Oława river valley, sometimes amidst dense forests, sometimes amidst vast heathlands and meadows. Ahead, like a laufer, ran the mastiff Beelzebub. The dog patrolled the road, sometimes disappearing into the forest, rummaging in thickets and grasses. Chasing and barking at startled hares or jays, however, did not happen; it was clearly beneath the dignity of the black beast. Urban Horn, the mysterious stranger with cold eyes, riding beside the wagon on his black colt, never had to scold or call back the dog.
Dorota Faber drove the priest's wagon, hitched to a dun gelding. The red-haired harlot from Brzeg had begged this of the pastor and clearly treated it as a kind of payment for the ride. And she drove excellently, with great skill. This way, Father Filip Granciszek, sitting beside her on the driver's seat, could doze or discuss without fear for the vehicle.
On the wagon, on sacks of oats—depending on the circumstances—Reynevan and Rabbi Hiram ben Eliezer dozed or discussed.
At the end, tied to the side-rail, trotted the scrawny Jewish mare.
So they rode, dozed, discussed, stopped, discussed, dozed. They ate this and that. They drank a clay jug of vodka that Father Granciszek had pulled from his saddlebags. They drank another, which Rabbi Hiram pulled from under his fur coat.
Quickly, just beyond Brzezimierz, it came to light that the pastor and the Jew were traveling to Strzelin for almost identical purposes—for an audience with the canon of the Wrocław chapter, who was visiting the town and parish. However, if Father Granciszek was traveling, as he confessed, by summons, not to say on the carpet, the rabbi only hoped to obtain an audience. The pastor didn't give him much chance.
"The venerable canon," he said, "has a lot of work there. Numerous matters, courts, countless audiences. For difficult times have befallen us, oh, difficult."
"As if," Dorota Faber pulled the reins, "they were ever easy."
"I speak of difficult times for the Church," Father Granciszek emphasized. "And for the true faith. For the cockle of heresy is spreading, spreading. You meet someone, they greet you in God's name, and you wouldn't guess if they weren't a heretic. Did you say something, rabbi?"
76
"Love thy neighbour," mumbled Hiram ben Eliezer, whether not in his sleep. "The prophet Elijah can appear with any face."
"Oh," Father Filip waved his hand dismissively. "Jewish philosophy. And I say: vigilance and work, vigilance, work, and prayer. For Peter's rock trembles and sways. The cockle of heresy is spreading, spreading all around."
"That," Urban Horn reined in his horse to ride right beside the wagon, "you've already said, pater."
"And it's true," Father Granciszek, it seemed, was completely awake now. "No matter how many times one says it, it's true. Heresy is spreading, apostasy is multiplying. False prophets are springing up like mushrooms after rain, ready with their false teachings to distort God's Law. Truly, the apostle Paul wrote prophetically to Timothy: 'For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.' And they will claim, Christ have mercy, that in the name of truth they do what they do."
"Everything in this world," Urban Horn remarked nonchalantly, "is done under the banner of fighting for truth. And though it's usually about very different truths, one truth benefits from this. The real one."
"That sounded heretical," the priest frowned, "what you said. As for me, let me tell you, regarding truth, I am more in agreement with what Master Johann Nider wrote in his *Formicarius*. And he compared heretics to those ants living in India, which diligently pick out gold specks from the sand and carry them to their anthill, though they derive no benefit from that metal, neither eating it nor plucking it. Such are, writes Master Nider in *Formicarius*, the heretics, who delve into Holy Scripture and search for grains of truth in it, though they themselves do not know what they would do with that truth."
"That was very beautiful," sighed Dorota Faber, urging the gelding on. "About those ants, I mean. Oh, almost, when I listen to someone so wise, it makes my stomach clench."
The priest paid no attention either to her or her stomach.
"The Cathars," he preached, "otherwise known as Albigensians, who bit the hand that wanted to restore them to the bosom of the Church, like wolves. Waldensians and Lollards, daring to revile the Church and the Holy Father, and calling the liturgy the barking of dogs. The loathsome renegade Bogomils and their ilk, the Paulicians. Alexians and Patripassians, daring to deny the Holy Trinity. Fraticelli from Lombardy, those ragamuffins and bandits, who have more than one clergyman on their conscience. Similar to them are the Dulcinians, followers of Fra Dolcino. Item, various other apostates: Priscillianists, Petrobrusians, Arnoldists, Speronists, Passagians, Messalians, Apostolic Brethren, Pastorelles, Patarenes, and Amauricians. Poplicans and Turlupins, denying the divinity in Christ and rejecting the sacraments, while bowing to the devil. Luciferians, whose name
77
clearly states to whom they blasphemously pay homage. And of course, the Hussites, enemies of the faith, the Church, and the Pope..."
"To make it funnier," Urban Horn interjected with a smile, "all those you mentioned consider themselves righteous, and they regard others as enemies of the faith. As for the Pope, you must admit, Father Pastor, that it is sometimes difficult to choose the right one among the many. As for the Church, all of them, to a man, cry out for the necessity of reform, *in capite et in membris*. Doesn't that make you wonder, venerable sir?"
"I don't quite understand your words," Filip Granciszek admitted. "But if you meant that heresy grows within the very bosom of the Church, then you are right. Very close to this sin are those who err in faith, who in their pride exaggerate piety. *Corruptio optimi pessima!* To cite, for example, the case of the well-known flagellants. As early as 1349, Pope Clement VI declared them heretics, excommunicated them, and ordered them to be punished, but did that help at all?"
"It didn't help at all," declared Horn. "They still roamed all over Germany, causing amusement, for there were countless wenches among them, and they would scourge themselves, stripped to the waist, with their tits out. Sometimes with quite nice tits, and I know what I'm talking about, I saw their processions in Bamberg, in Goslar, and in Fürstenwalde. Oh, those little tits of theirs did bounce, they did bounce! The last council condemned them again, but that won't do any good either. Some plague or other calamity will come, and the flagellant processions will start again. They simply must like it."
"One learned master in Prague," a somewhat dreamy Reynevan joined the discussion, "argued that it's a disease. That some women find blessedness precisely in being scourged naked, in front of everyone. That's why there were and are so many women among the flagellants."
"I wouldn't advise citing Prague masters at this time," Father Filip suggested tartly. "Nevertheless, there's something to it. The Preaching Friars argue that much evil stems from carnal lust, and that in woman it is insatiable."
"Leave women," Dorota Faber spoke up unexpectedly, "in peace. For you yourselves are not without sin."
"In the Garden of Eden," Granciszek glanced at her, "the serpent set its sights not on Adam, but on Eve, and it probably knew what it was doing. So the Dominicans probably know what they're talking about. But it wasn't my intention to slander women, only that many of the current heresies, by some strange coincidence, have lust and debauchery at their core, as if by some apish perversity, fie, the Church forbids, so let's do the opposite. Does the Church command modesty? Well then, let's stick out our bare arses! Does it call for temperance and propriety? Come on, let's rut like cats in March! Picards and Adamites in Bohemia go about completely naked and copulate all with all, wallowing in sin like dogs, not people. The Apostolic Brethren, Segarelli's sect, did likewise. The Condormientes of Cologne, or
78
'those sleeping together,' have carnal relations with each other regardless of sex or kinship. The Paterniani, so called after their wicked apostle, Paternus of Paphlagonia, do not recognize the sacrament of marriage, which does not prevent them from indulging in communal debauchery, especially that which makes conception impossible."
"Interesting," Urban Horn said thoughtfully.
Reynevan blushed, and Dorota snorted, proving that the matter was not entirely foreign to her.
The wagon jolted on a bump, so sharply that Rabbi Hiram woke up, and Father Granciszek, who was about to launch into another speech, nearly bit off his tongue. Dorota Faber clucked at the gelding, snapped the reins. The presbyter adjusted his position on the driver's seat.
"There were and are others too," he continued, "who sin in the same way as the flagellants, meaning with excessive piety, from which it is only a step to perversions and heresy. Like, for example, the Disciplinati, similar to the flagellants, like the Battuti, like the Circumcellions, like the Bianchi, or Whites, like the Humiliati, like the so-called Lyons Brethren, like the Joachimites. We know this from our own Silesian backyard too. I'm talking about the Beghards of Świdnica and Nysa."
Reynevan, though he had a slightly different opinion of Beghards and Beguines, nodded his head. Urban Horn did not nod.
"The Beghards," he said calmly, "called *fratres de voluntaria paupertate*, the voluntarily poor, could have been a model for many priests and monks. They also had considerable merits for society. Suffice it to say that it was the Beguines in their hospitals who suppressed the plague in the year sixty, preventing the epidemic from spreading. And that means thousands of people saved from death. Indeed, the Beguines were beautifully repaid for this. With accusations of heresy."
"There were among them," the priest agreed, "indeed, many pious people full of devotion. But there were also apostates and sinners. Many Beguinages, and even those praised hospices, turned out to be cradles of sin, blasphemy, heresy, and vile debauchery. Much evil also took root among the wandering Beghards."
"You are free to think so."
"Me?" Granciszek huffed. "I am a simple pastor from Oława, what do I have to do with thinking? The Beghards were condemned by the Council of Vienne and Pope Clement, almost a hundred years before my birth. I wasn't in the world when, in the year thirteen hundred and thirty-two, the Inquisition exposed among the Beguines and Beghards practices as horrible as digging up graves and profaning corpses. I wasn't in the world in seventy-two, when, by virtue of new papal edicts, the Inquisition was renewed in Świdnica. The investigation, which proved the heresy of the Beguines and their connections with the renegade Brotherhood and Sisterhood of the Free Spirit, with Picard and Turlupin filth, as a result of which Dowager Duchess Agnes closed the Świdnica Beguinages, and the Beghards and Beguines..."
79
"Beghards and Beguines," Urban Horn finished, "were hunted and pursued throughout Silesia. But here too, you'll gladly wash your hands of it, Oława pastor, because it was before your birth. Know that it was also before mine. Which doesn't prevent me from knowing how it really was. That most of the captured Beghards and Beguines were tortured to death in dungeons. Those who survived were burned. And a considerable group, as usual, saved their skins by denouncing others, delivering companions, friends, even close relatives to torture and death. Some of the traitors later donned Dominican habits and displayed a truly neophytic zeal in the fight against heresy."
"You think," the pastor looked at him sharply, "that's bad?"
"To denounce?"
"To fight heresy with zeal. You think that's bad?"
Horn turned sharply in his saddle, and his face changed.
"Don't try," he hissed, "those tricks with me, pater. Don't be, for fuck's sake, such a Bernard Gui. What will you gain from cornering me with a tricky question? Look around. We're not at the Dominicans', but in the Brzezimierz Woods. If I feel threatened, I'll simply bash your head in and throw you into a tree hollow. And in Strzelin, I'll say you died on the way from a sudden overheating of the blood, from a surge of fluids and humors."
The priest paled.
"Fortunately for both of us," Horn finished calmly, "it won't come to that, for I am neither a Beghard, nor a heretic, nor a sectarian from the brotherhood of the free spirit. But don't try inquisitorial tricks, Oława pastor. Agreed? Huh?"
Filip Granciszek didn't answer, just nodded his head a few times.

***

When they stopped to stretch their legs, Reynevan couldn't hold back. He privately asked Urban Horn the reason for his sharp reaction. Horn initially didn't want to talk, limiting himself to a few curses and grumbles about damned homegrown inquisitors. Seeing, however, that this wasn't enough for Reynevan, he sat on a fallen log and called his dog.
"All their heresies, Lancelot," he began quietly, "concern me as much as last year's snow. Though only a fool, and I don't consider myself one, wouldn't notice that this is a *signum temporis* and that it's time to draw conclusions. That maybe it would be worth changing something? Reforming or something? I try to understand. And I can understand that it gets to them when they hear that there is no God, that one can and should whistle at the Decalogue, and that Lucifer must be worshipped. I understand them when they scream about heresy at such a dictum. But what turns out? What enrages them the most? Not apostasy and godlessness, not the negation of sacraments, not revisions of dogmas or denial of the same, not demonolatry. What infuriates them most are calls for evangelical poverty. For humility. For devotion. For serving. God and people. They go mad when someone demands they renounce power and money. That's why they threw themselves with such fury at the Bianchi, at the Humiliati, at Gerard Groote's brotherhood, at the Beguines and Beghards, at Hus. Dammit, I consider it a miracle they didn't burn the Poverello, Francis the Little Poor Man! But I fear that every day a pyre burns somewhere, and on it some anonymous, unknown, and forgotten Poverello."
Reynevan nodded his head.
"That's why," Horn finished, "it annoys me so much."
Reynevan nodded once more. Urban Horn watched him attentively.
"I've talked too much, no doubt about it," he yawned. "And such talk can be dangerous. Many a man has, as they say, cut his own throat with his own overly long tongue... But I trust you, Lancelot. You don't even know why."
"Oh, but I do," Reynevan smiled forcedly. "If you suspected I was informing, you'd bash my head in, and in Strzelin you'd say I died from a sudden surge of fluids and humors."
Urban Horn smiled. Very wolfishly.

***

"Horn?"
"I'm listening, Lancelot."
"It's not hard to see that you're a well-traveled and knowledgeable man. Do you happen to know which of the magnates has estates in the close vicinity of Brzeg?"
"And whence," Urban Horn's eyes narrowed, "this curiosity? So dangerous in these times?"
"From the usual place. Curiosity."
"How else," Horn raised the corners of his lips in a smile, but the suspicious glint by no means disappeared from his eyes. "Well, I shall satisfy your curiosity to the best of my modest abilities. In the vicinity of Brzeg, you say? Konradswaldau belongs to the Haugwitz family. The Bischofsheims are seated in Jankowice, Hermsdorf is the Gall family's estate... As for Schönau, from what I know, Bertold de Apolda, the cupbearer, resides there..."
"Does any of them have a daughter? Young, fair-haired..."
"My knowledge," Horn cut him off, "does not extend that far. Nor is it accustomed to. And I advise you against it too, Lancelot. Ordinary curiosity, knights can tolerate, but they greatly dislike it when someone takes too much interest in their daughters. And wives..."
"I understand."
"Good."

**Chapter 7**
in which Reynevan and his company arrive in Strzelin on the eve of the Assumption of Mary and, as it turns out, just in time for a burning. Then, those who should, listen to the teachings of the canon of Wrocław Cathedral. Some with more, others with less enthusiasm.

Beyond the village of Höckricht, near Wiązów, the hitherto empty highway became somewhat populated. Besides peasant carts and merchant wagons, horsemen and armed men also appeared, so Reynevan deemed it advisable to cover his head with his hood. Beyond Höckricht, the road, winding through picturesque birch groves, became deserted again, and Reynevan breathed a sigh of relief. A little prematurely.
Beelzebub once again demonstrated great canine wisdom. Until now, he hadn't even growled at the soldiers passing them, but now, unfailingly sensing their intentions, he warned with a short but sharp bark about the armed men on horseback who unexpectedly emerged from the birch groves on both sides of the road. He also growled ominously when, upon seeing him, one of the squires accompanying the knights took a crossbow from his back.
"Hey, you there! Halt!" shouted one of the knights, young and freckled as a quail's egg. "Halt, I say! Stay where you are!"
The mounted squire riding beside the knight inserted his foot into the crossbow's stirrup, skillfully drew it, and armed it with a bolt. Urban Horn rode slightly ahead at a light pace.
"Don't you dare shoot the dog, Neudeck. Take a good look at him first. And come to the conclusion that you've seen him before."
"By God's five wounds!" The freckled man shielded his eyes with his hand to protect them from the blinding flicker of the wind-tossed birch leaves. "Horn? Is that really you?"
"None other. Tell the squire to leave the crossbow."
"Sure, sure. But keep the dog. Besides, we're here on an investigation. In pursuit. So I must ask you, Horn, who is with you? Who is riding?"
82
"Let's first clarify," Urban Horn said coolly, "this matter: for whom are you gentlemen in pursuit? Because if it's for cattle rustlers, for example, then we're out. For many reasons. Firstly: we have no cattle. Secondly..."
"Alright, alright," the freckled one had already managed to look at the priest and the rabbi, and waved his hand dismissively. "Just tell me: do you know all these people?"
"I know them. Is that enough?"
"Enough."
"We beg your pardon, venerable sir," the second knight, in a sallet and full armor, bowed slightly before Pastor Granciszek, "but we are by no means inconveniencing you for mere amusement. A crime has been committed, and we are on the trail of the murderer. By order of Sir von Reideburg, the Strzelin starosta. This here is the noble Sir Kunad von Neudeck. And I am Eustachy von Rochow."
"What crime is this?" asked the pastor. "By God! Was someone killed?"
"Killed. Not far from here. The noble Albrecht Bart, lord of Karczyn."
For a while, there was silence. In which Urban Horn's voice was heard. And it was a changed voice.
"How? How did it happen?"
"It happened strangely," Eustachy von Rochow replied slowly, after a moment he had devoted to suspicious observation. "Firstly: in broad daylight. Secondly: in combat. If it weren't impossible, I'd say it was a duel. It was one man, mounted, armed. He killed with a sword thrust, and a very sure one, requiring great skill. In the face. Between the nose and the eye."
"Where?"
"A quarter of a mile beyond Strzelin. Sir Bart was returning from a visit to a neighbour."
"Alone? Without men?"
"That's how he rode. He had no enemies."
"Eternal rest," murmured Father Granciszek, "grant unto him, O Lord. And light..."
"He had no enemies," Horn repeated, interrupting the prayers. "But are there suspects?"
Kunad Neudeck rode closer to the wagon, eyeing Dorota Faber's bust with clear interest. The courtesan gifted him with a lovely smile. Eustachy von Rochow also rode up. And he too bared his teeth. Reynevan was very pleased. Because no one was looking at him.
"There are," Neudeck tore his gaze away, "several suspects. A few suspicious characters were loitering in the area. Some pursuit, some family feud, something of that sort. Individuals like Kunz Aulock, Walter de Barby, and Stoik of Gorgowice were even seen here. Rumor has it that some young lad seduced a knight's wife, and that knight is seriously set on getting the rascal. And is chasing after him."
"It cannot be ruled out," added von Rochow, "that this pursued rascal, having chanced upon Sir Bart, panicked and killed Sir Bart."
83
"If so," Urban Horn picked his ear, "then you'll easily get him, this, as you say, young spark. He must be more than seven feet tall and about four across the shoulders. It's a bit hard for such a fellow to hide among ordinary people."
"True," Kunad Neudeck admitted grimly. "Sir Bart was no weakling, he wouldn't have been bested by just any lout... But it could be that sorcery or witchcraft was used there. They say that seducer of other men's wives is also a sorcerer."
"Most Holy Mother!" exclaimed Dorota Faber, and Father Filip crossed himself.
"And besides," Neudeck finished, "it will all come out. Because when we catch this young spark, we'll question him about the details, oh, we'll question him... And it won't be hard to recognize him one way or another. We know he's comely and rides a grey horse. If you should encounter such a one..."
"We shall not fail to report it," Urban Horn promised calmly. "A comely youth, a grey horse. Impossible to overlook. Or mistake for anything else. Farewell."
"Do the gentlemen perhaps know," Father Granciszek inquired, "if the Wrocław canon is still staying in Strzelin?"
"Indeed. He is holding court at the Dominicans'."
"Is it His Reverence Notary Lichtenberg?"
"No," denied von Rochow. "His name is Beess. Otto Beess."
"Otto Beess, provost of Saint John the Baptist," murmured the priest, as soon as the starosta's knights had gone their way and Dorota Faber had urged the gelding on. "He is a stern man. Very stern. Oh, rabbi, slim hopes that he will grant you an audience."
"Not at all," spoke Reynevan, beaming for a few moments. "You will be received, Rabbi Hiram. I promise you that."
Everyone looked at him, but Reynevan only smiled mysteriously. Then, very cheerful, he jumped off the wagon and walked beside it. He fell slightly behind, at which point Horn rode up to him.
"Now you see," he said quietly, "how it is, Reinmar Bielau. How quickly ill repute sticks. Hired thugs, villains of Kyrieleison's and Walter de Barby's ilk, ride around the countryside, and if they kill someone, suspicion falls on you first. Do you notice the irony of fate?"
"I notice," Reynevan grumbled, "two things. First, that you do know who I am. Probably from the very beginning."
"Probably. And the second?"
"That you knew the murdered man. That Albrecht Bart of Karczyn. And I'll bet my head that you're going to Karczyn. Or were going."
"Well, now," Horn said after a moment, "how clever you are. And how self-assured. I even know whence this assurance flows. It's good to have acquaintances in high places, eh? Wrocław canons? One immediately feels better. And safer. Yet it can be a deceptive feeling, oh, so deceptive."
84
"I know," Reynevan nodded. "I constantly remember the tree hollow. The humors and fluids."
"And it's very good that you remember."

***

The road led up a hill on which stood a gallows, and on it hung three hanged men, all dried out like stockfish. And below, Strzelin spread out before the travelers, with its colorful suburb, town wall, castle from the times of Bolko the Strict, the very ancient rotunda of Saint Gothard, and the modern towers of monastic churches.
"Oh," Dorota Faber observed. "Something's happening there. Is it some holiday today or what?"
Indeed, in the open space beneath the town wall, quite a large crowd had gathered. From the direction of the gate, a procession could be seen heading that way.
"A procession, I think."
"More like mystery plays," stated Granciszek. "For today is the fourteenth of August, the eve of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. Let's go, let's go, Miss Dorota. Let's see it up close."
Dorota clucked at the gelding. Urban Horn called the mastiff and put him on a leash, evidently aware that amidst the crowd, even a dog as wise as Beelzebub might lose control.
The procession coming from the town had approached enough for one to distinguish in it several clergymen in liturgical vestments, several black-and-white Dominicans, several grey-brown Franciscans, several mounted knights in jacks adorned with coats of arms, several townsmen in delias reaching almost to the ground. And a dozen or so halberdiers in yellow tunics and dully gleaming sallets.
"Bishop's soldiers," Urban Horn informed quietly, proving his good information for the umpteenth time. "And that large knight, the one on the bay horse, with the checkerboard emblem, that's Henryk von Reideburg, starosta of Strzelin."
The bishop's soldiers were leading three people by the arm, two men and a woman. The woman wore a white shift, one of the men wore a pointed, brightly painted cap.
Dorota Faber snapped the reins, shouted at the gelding and at the crowd of townsfolk reluctantly parting before the wagon. Having descended the hill, however, the wagon's passengers lost visibility—to see anything, they had to stand up, and for that, the vehicle had to be stopped. And anyway, it was impossible to go further, the crowd had already become too dense.
85
Standing up, Reynevan saw the heads and shoulders of the three, two men and a woman. And rising above their heads, the stakes to which they were tied. He didn't see the pyres of brushwood piled up under the stakes. But he knew they were there.
He heard a voice, raised and loud, but indistinct, muffled and broken by the drone of the crowd. He recognized the words with difficulty.
"Crimes directed against the social order... *Errores Hussitarum*... *Fides haeretica*... Blasphemy and sacrilege... *Crimen*... Proven in the investigation..."
"It seems," said Urban Horn, standing in his stirrups, "that an ocular summary of our travel dispute is about to take place here."
"It looks like it," Reynevan swallowed. "Hey, people! Who are they going to execute?"
"Heretics," explained a man with the appearance of a beggar, turning around. "They caught heretics. They say, Hussites or something like that..."
"Not Hussites, but Huss-ites," corrected another, similarly tattered, with an identical Polish accent. "They'll burn them for sacrilege. Because they gave communion to geese."
"Eh, ignorance!" commented a pilgrim with shells sewn onto his cloak from the other side of the wagon. "They know nothing!"
"And you know?"
"I know... Praised be Jesus Christ!" The pilgrim noticed Father Granciszek's tonsure. "The heretics are called Hussites, and it comes from their prophet Hus, not from geese. They say, the Hussites that is, that there is no purgatory at all, and they receive communion in both kinds, that is, *sub utraque specie*. That's why they're also called Utraquists..."
"Don't lecture us," Urban Horn interrupted, "for we are already learned. Those three, I ask, what will they be burned for?"
"That I don't know. I'm not from around here."
"That one there," a local, judging by his clay-stained jerkin, a brickmaker, hurried to explain. "The one in the shameful cap is a Czech, a Hussite envoy, an apostate priest. He came from Tabor in disguise, incited people to rebellion, to burning churches. His own countrymen, those who fled Prague after the year nineteen, recognized him. And the other one is Antoni Nelke, a parish school teacher, a local accomplice of the Czech heretic. He gave him shelter and distributed Hussite writings with him."
"And the woman?"
"Elżbieta Ehrlichowa. She's a completely different kettle of fish. By the way. She poisoned her husband with her lover in conspiracy. The lover escaped, otherwise he'd be at the stake too."
86
"Now the cat's out of the bag," interjected a thin fellow in a felt cap that clung smoothly to his skull. "For this is her second husband, Ehrlichowa's I mean. She undoubtedly poisoned the first one too, the shrew."
"Maybe she poisoned him, maybe she didn't, it's a toss-up," a fat townswoman in an embroidered sheepskin jerkin joined the discussion. "They say the previous one drank himself to death. He was a shoemaker."
"Shoemaker or not, she poisoned him, as sure as amen in the Lord's Prayer," the thin man pronounced. "There must have been some witchcraft involved too, for her to fall under Dominican jurisdiction..."
"If she poisoned him, then it serves her right."
"Of course, it serves her right!"
"Quiet!" shouted Pastor Granciszek, craning his neck. "The priests are reading the verdict, and nothing can be heard."
"And why should it be heard?" Urban Horn scoffed. "After all, everything is known. Those on the pyres are *haeretici pessimi et notorii*. And the Church, which abhors blood, entrusts the punishment of the guilty to the *brachium saeculare*, the secular arm..."
"Quiet, I said!"
"*Ecclesia non sitit sanguinem*," came a voice from the direction of the pyres, broken by the wind and muffled by the murmur of the crowd. "The Church does not thirst for blood and shrinks from it... Let justice and punishment therefore be meted out by the *brachium saeculare*, the secular arm. *Requiem aeternam dona eis*..."
The crowd roared with a great voice. Something was happening at the pyres. Reynevan stood up, but too late. The executioner was already at the woman, did something behind her back, as if adjusting the rope binding her neck. The woman's head fell to her shoulder, softly, like a cut flower.
"He strangled her," the pastor sighed quietly, as if he hadn't seen anything similar before. "Broke her neck. The teacher too. They must have both shown remorse during the investigation."
"And informed on someone," added Urban Horn. "Standard procedure."
The mob howled and cursed, dissatisfied with the mercy shown to the teacher and the poisoner. The shouting intensified when a living flame burst from the bundles of brushwood, burst violently, instantly engulfing the entire pyres along with the stakes and the people tied to them. The fire roared, rose high, the crowd, struck by the heat, retreated, making the crush even greater.
"Shoddy work!" shouted the brickmaker. "Crappy job! They took dry brushwood, dry! Like straw!"
"Indeed, shoddy work," judged the thin man in the felt cap. "The Hussite couldn't even utter a sound! They don't know how to burn. Back home, in Franconia, the abbot of Fulda, oh, he knew how! He supervised the pyres himself. He had the logs arranged so that first only the legs would roast, up to the knees, then higher, up to the balls, then..."
87
"Thief!" shrieked a woman hidden in the crowd. "Thieeeeeef! Catch the thief!"
Somewhere in the crowd a child was crying, someone was playing a fife, someone was swearing, someone was laughing, convulsed in nervous, idiotic laughter.
The pyres roared with fire, emitting strong blasts of heat. The wind blew towards the travelers, bringing a hideous, suffocating, sweetish smell of burning corpse. Reynevan covered his nose with his sleeve. Father Granciszek coughed, Dorota choked, Urban Horn spat, grimacing terribly. Rabbi Hiram, however, surprised everyone. The Jew leaned out of the wagon and vomited, as violently as it was copiously – onto the pilgrim, onto the brickmaker, onto the townswoman, onto the Franconian, and onto everyone else nearby. The area around immediately cleared.
"Please forgive me..." the rabbi managed to babble between further paroxysms. "This is no political demonstration. This is ordinary puke."

***

Canon Otto Beess, provost of Saint John the Baptist, settled more comfortably, adjusted his pileus, and examined the claret swirling in his goblet.
"Please," he said in his usual grating voice, "ensure that the burnt site is thoroughly cleaned and raked. All remains, even the smallest, please collect and scatter into the river. For instances of collecting charred little bones are multiplying. And worshipping them as relics. I ask that the honorable councilmen see to this. And that the brothers oversee it being seen to."
The Strzelin councilmen present in the castle chamber bowed in silence, the Dominicans and Friars Minor lowered their tonsured heads. Both knew that the canon was accustomed to asking, not ordering. They also knew that the difference was only in the word.
"The Preaching Friars," Otto Beess continued, "I ask that they continue, in accordance with the guidelines of the bull *Inter cunctas*, to vigilantly monitor all manifestations of heresy and the activities of Taborite emissaries. And to report on the smallest and seemingly insignificant matters connected with such activity. I am also counting here on the help of the secular arm. For which I ask you, noble Sir Henryk."
Henryk Reideburg bowed his head, but only slightly, then immediately straightened his powerful figure in the checkerboard-adorned *wapenrok*. The Starosta of Strzelin did not hide his pride and arrogance, not even attempting to feign humility and meekness. It was clear that he tolerated the visitation of the church hierarchy because he had to, but was only waiting for the canon to finally leave his territory.
Otto Beess knew this.
88
"I also ask you, Starost Henryk," he added, "to exert greater efforts than hitherto in the investigation into the murder of Sir Albrecht von Bart, committed near Karczyn. The Chapter is keenly interested in apprehending the perpetrators of this crime. Sir von Bart, despite a certain harshness and controversial nature of his views, was a worthy man, *vir rarae dexteritatis*, a great benefactor of the Cistercians of Henryków and Krzeszów. We demand that his murderers receive their deserved punishment. Obviously, we are talking about the real murderers. The Chapter will not be satisfied with blaming a sparrow in the hand. For we do not believe that Sir Bart died at the hands of those Wycliffites burned today."
"Those Hussites," Reideburg cleared his throat, "might have had some accomplices..."
"We do not exclude that," the canon pierced the knight with his gaze. "We exclude nothing. Give greater impetus to the investigation, Knight Henryk. Ask, if necessary, for the help of the Świdnica starosta, Sir Albrecht von Kolditz. Ask, for that matter, whomever you wish. As long as there are results."
Henryk Reideburg bowed stiffly. The canon bowed back, but rather carelessly.
"Thank you, noble knight," he spoke in a voice that sounded like the opening of a rusty cemetery gate. "I will not detain you longer. I also thank the gentlemen councilors and the holy brothers. I do not interrupt your duties, of which, I trust, you have an abundance."
The starosta, councilors, and monks exited, shuffling their boots and sandals.
"The gentlemen clerics and deacons," the canon of Wrocław Cathedral added after a moment, "also, I presume, remember their duties. Please proceed to them. Immediately. The brother secretary and the father confessor remain. Also..."
Otto Beess raised his head and pierced Reynevan with his gaze.
"You too stay, boy. I have something to discuss with you. But first, I will receive the petitioners. Please summon the pastor from Oława."
Father Granciszek, when he entered, his face changed color, paling and reddening alternately in a quite incomprehensible manner. He immediately knelt. The canon did not bid him rise.
"Your problem, Father Filip," he began gratingly, "is a lack of respect and trust in authority. Individuality and one's own opinion are indeed valuable, sometimes much more worthy of recognition and praise than dull and sheepish obedience. However, there are matters in which authority is absolutely right and infallible. As, for example, our Pope Martin V in the dispute with the conciliarists, various Gersons and various little Poles: Włodkowices, Wyszes, and Łaskarzes, who would like to subject every decision of the Holy Father to discussion. And interpret it according to their own whim. But it is not so, not so! *Roma locuta, causa finita*."
89
"Therefore, dear Father Philip, if ecclesiastical authority tells you what to preach, you are to be obedient. Even if your individuality protests and screams, you are to be obedient. Because clearly, a higher purpose is at stake. Higher than you, naturally. And than your entire parish. I see you want to say something. Speak then."
"Three-quarters of my parishioners," mumbled Father Granciszek, "are not very bright people, I would say, *pro maiori parte illiterati et idiotae*. But there is still that one quarter. The one to whom I can in no way say in my sermons what the curia recommends. I do say, indeed, that the Hussites are heretics, murderers, and degenerates, and that Žižka and Koranda are incarnate devils, criminals, blasphemers, and sacrilegists, that eternal damnation and hellish torments await them. But I cannot say that they eat infants. And that their wives are communal. And that..."
"You didn't understand?" the canon interrupted him sharply. "You didn't grasp my words, pastor? *Roma locuta!* And for you, Rome is Wrocław. You are to preach as you were told, preacher. About communal wives, about eaten infants, about nuns boiled alive, about tearing out the tongues of Catholic priests, about sodomy. When you receive such guidelines, you will preach that from communion with the chalice, Hussites grow hair on their palates and dog tails on their rumps. I am not joking at all, I have seen the relevant documents in the bishop's chancellery."
"Besides," he added, looking with slight pity at the shrunken Granciszek, "how do you know they don't grow tails? Have you been to Prague? To Tabor? To Hradec Králové? Did you receive communion *sub utraque specie*?"
"No!" the pastor almost choked on his breath. "Not at all!"
"That's very good. *Causa finita*. The audience too. In Wrocław, I'll say that a reprimand was sufficient, that there will be no more trouble with you. Now, so that you don't get the impression of a fruitless peregrination, you will confess to my confessor. And you will perform the penance he assigns you. Father Felicjan!"
"Yes, Your Reverence?"
"Lying prostrate before the main altar at Saint Gothard's, the whole night, from Compline to Prime. The rest is at your discretion."
"May God protect..."
"Amen. Fare you well, pastor."
Otto Beess sighed, extended an empty goblet towards a cleric, who immediately filled it with claret.
"No more petitioners today. Allow me, Reinmar."
"Venerable father... Before... I have a request..."
"I'm listening."
"A rabbi from Brzeg accompanied me on my journey and arrived with me..."
Otto Beess gestured an order. In a moment, a cleric ushered in Hiram ben Eliezer. The Jew bowed deeply, sweeping the floor with his fox-fur cap. The canon observed him intently.
90
"What is it," he rasped, "that the spokesman for the Brzeg kahal desires of me? On what business does he come?"
"The venerable priest asks, on what business?" Rabbi Hiram raised his bushy eyebrows. "God of Abraham! And on what business, I ask myself, can a Jew come to the venerable canon? What, I ask myself, can it be about? Then I answer that it is about truth. Evangelical truth."
"Evangelical truth?"
"None other."
"Speak, Rabbi Hiram. Do not make me wait."
"As the venerable priest commands, I shall speak at once, why should I not speak? I say thus: various gentlemen walk about Brzeg, Oława, Grodków, and also the surrounding villages, and they call for the beating of the wicked murderers of Jesus Christ, for the robbing of their homes and the shaming of their wives and daughters. These criers invoke the venerable prelates, as if such beating, robbery, and rape were by divine and episcopal will."
"Continue, friend Hiram. You see, I am patient."
"What more is there to say? I, Rabbi Hiram ben Eliezer of the Brzeg kahal, implore the venerable priest to uphold evangelical truths. If one must beat and rob the murderers of Jesus Christ, then please, beat them! But, by forefather Moses, beat the right ones. Those who crucified him. Meaning, the Romans!"
Otto Beess was silent for a long time, observing the rabbi from under half-closed eyelids.
"Yeees," he spoke at last. "And do you know, friend Hiram, that for such talk they can lock you up? I speak, of course, of the secular authorities. The Church is lenient, but the *brachium saeculare* can be heavy when it comes to blasphemy. No, no, say nothing, friend Hiram. I will speak."
The Jew bowed. The canon did not change his position in the armchair, did not even flinch.
"The Holy Father Martin, fifth of that name, following in the footsteps of his enlightened predecessors, was pleased to declare that Jews, contrary to appearances, are created in God's image and a part of them, however small, will attain salvation. It is therefore inappropriate to persecute them, discriminate against them, repress them, oppress them, and subject them to any other form of torment, including forced baptism. You do not doubt, I trust, friend Hiram, that the Pope's will is a command for every clergyman. Or perhaps you doubt it?"
"How can I doubt? This must be the tenth Pope in a row to speak of this... So it must be true, no doubt..."
"If you do not doubt," the canon interrupted, pretending not to hear the mockery, "then you must understand that accusing clergy of inciting attacks on Israelites is slander. I will add: punishable slander."
The Jew bowed in silence.
91
"Of course," Otto Beess narrowed his eyes slightly, "laypeople know little or nothing about papal decrees. Also, Holy Scripture is not easy for them. For they are, as someone quite recently told me, *pro maiori parte illiterati et idiotae*."
Rabbi Hiram did not even flinch.
"And your Israelite tribe, rabbi," the canon continued, "with predilection and persistence provides pretexts to the rabble. One time you cause a plague epidemic, having poisoned the wells, another time you torture an innocent Christian maiden, yet another you drain blood from a child for matzah. You steal and desecrate hosts. You engage in vile usury and cut pieces of living flesh from a debtor who cannot repay your thievish interest. And you engage in various other foul practices. As I presume."
"What must be done, I ask the venerable priest," Hiram ben Eliezer asked after a tense moment. "What must be done so that these things do not happen? Meaning, the poisoning of wells, the torturing of maidens, the draining of blood, and the desecration of hosts? What, I ask, is needed?"
Otto Beess was silent for a long time.
"Any day now," he said at last, "a special, one-time tax, covering everyone, will be proclaimed. For the anti-Hussite crusade. Every Jew will have to pay one gulden. The Brzeg community, beyond what it must give, will add of its own free will... One thousand guldens. Two hundred and fifty marks."
The rabbi nodded his beard. Without attempting to bargain.
"This money will serve the common good," the canon noted without special emphasis. "And a common, I would say, cause. The Czech heretics threaten us all. Most of all us, true Catholics, of course, but you Israelites also have no reason to love the Hussites. Quite the contrary, I would say. Suffice it to recall March of the year twenty-two, the bloody pogrom in Prague's Old Town. The later massacres of Jews in Chomutov, Kutná Hora, and Písek. So there will be, Hiram, an opportunity to contribute to vengeance, even if only with a donation."
"Vengeance is mine," Hiram ben Eliezer replied after a moment. "Thus saith the Lord, Adonai. Repay no one evil for evil, saith the Lord. And our Lord, as the prophet Isaiah testifies, is generous in forgiveness."
"Besides," the rabbi added quietly, seeing the canon remain silent with his hand pressed to his forehead, "the Hussites have only been murdering Jews for six years. What is six compared to a thousand?"
Otto Beess raised his head. His eyes were as cold as steel.
"You will come to a bad end, friend Hiram," he rasped. "I fear for you. Depart in peace."
92
"Now," he said when the door closed behind the Jew, "it's finally your turn, Reinmar. We'll talk. You don't need to worry about the secretary and the cleric. They are trusted men. They are present, but as if they weren't."
Reynevan cleared his throat, but the canon didn't let him speak.
"Duke Konrad Kantner arrived in Wrocław four days ago, on Saint Lawrence's Day. With an entourage composed of monstrous gossips. The Duke himself is not discreet either. Thus, not only I, but almost all of Wrocław is already aware of the intricacies of the extramarital affair of Adela, wife of Gelfrad de Stercza."
Reynevan cleared his throat again, lowered his head, unable to bear the piercing gaze. The canon folded his hands as if in prayer.
"Reinmar, Reinmar," he spoke with a somewhat artificial exaltation. "How could you? How could you so offend divine and human law? For it is said: let marriage be held in honor and the bed undefiled, for God will judge fornicators and adulterers. And I will add from myself that very often, divine justice seems too slow for betrayed husbands. And very often they mete it out themselves. Severely they mete it out."
Reynevan cleared his throat even louder and bowed his head even lower.
"Aha," Otto Beess guessed. "They're already chasing you?"
"They are."
"Nipping at your heels?"
"They are."
"Young fool!" the clergyman spoke after a moment of silence. "Lock you up in the Narrenturm, that's what! In the Tower of Fools. You'd fit in perfectly with the tenants there."
Reynevan sniffled and made a face that, in his own opinion, was contrite. The canon nodded, sighed deeply, intertwined his fingers.
"You couldn't resist, could you?" he asked knowingly. "Did she appear in your dreams at night?"
"I couldn't," Reynevan admitted, blushing. "She did."
"I know, I know," Otto Beess licked his lips, and his eyes suddenly gleamed. "I know that forbidden fruit is sweet, that one desires, oh, desires to embrace unknown breasts. I know that honey drips from the lips of a strange woman, and her palate is smoother than oil. But in the end, believe me, the Proverbs of Solomon teach wisely: she will be bitter as wormwood and sharp as a two-edged sword, *amara quasi absinthium et acuta quasi gladius biceps*. Beware, son, lest you burn for her like a moth in a flame. Lest you follow her to death, lest you perish in the Abyss. Listen to the wise words of Scripture: go far from her on your way, do not approach the doors of her house, *longe fac ab ea viam tuam et ne adpropinques foribus domus eius*."
"Do not approach the doors of her house," the canon repeated, and from his voice, as if blown away by the wind, the preacher's exaltation vanished. "Lend an ear, Reinmar Bielau. Note well the words of Scripture and mine. Engrave them well in your memory. Listen to advice: stay away from a certain person. Do not do what you intend to do, which I read in your eyes, you rascal. Stay away from her."
"Yes, venerable father."
"The affair will be smoothed over somehow in time. The Sterczas will be scared off with the curia and the landfrieden, placated with the customary compensation of twenty marks, the usual fine of ten marks will also have to be paid to the Oleśnica magistrate. All this is little more than the value of a good thoroughbred horse, you'll manage to gather that much with your brother's help, and if need be, I'll contribute. Your uncle, Henryk the scholastic, was a good friend to me. And a teacher."
"Thanks be to..."
"But I can do nothing," the canon interrupted sharply, "if they catch you and beat you to death. Do you understand that, you reckless fool? You must get Gelfrad Stercza's wife out of your head once and for all, you must get visiting her secretly out of your head, letters, messengers, everything. You must disappear. Leave. I suggest Hungary. At once, without delay. Understood?"
"I'd like to go to Balbinów first... To my brother..."
"Absolutely not allowed," Otto Beess cut him off. "Those who are chasing you have certainly foreseen that. Just as they foresaw a visit to me. Remember: when one flees, one flees like a wolf. Never along paths one once walked."
"But my brother... Peterlin... If I really have to leave..."
"I myself, through trusted messengers, will inform Peterlin of everything. As for you, I forbid you to go there. Understood, madman? You are not allowed to travel paths your enemies know. You are not allowed to appear in places where they might be waiting for you. And that means, under no circumstances to Balbinów. And under no circumstances to Ziębice."
Reynevan audibly sighed, and Otto Beess audibly swore.
"You didn't know," he ground out. "You didn't know she was in Ziębice. It was I, old fool, who revealed it to you. Well, it's done. But it doesn't matter. It's irrelevant where she is. In Ziębice, in Rome, in Constantinople, or in Egypt, it's irrelevant. You will not approach her, son."
"I will not."
"You don't know how much I'd like to believe you. Listen to me, Reinmar, and listen carefully. You will receive a letter, I'll have the secretary write it immediately. Don't worry, the letter will be worded so that only the addressee can understand it. You will take the letter and proceed like a hunted wolf. Along paths you have never walked and where they will not look for you, you will go to Strzegom, to the Carmelite monastery. You will give my letter to the prior there, and he will then introduce you to a certain man. To him, when you are alone, you will say: July eighteenth, year eighteen. He will then ask you: where? You will answer: Wrocław, New Town. Have you memorized it? Repeat."
94
"July eighteenth, year eighteen. Wrocław, New Town. And what is all this for? I don't understand."
"If things were to get really dangerous," the canon explained calmly, "I won't be able to save you. Unless I tonsure you as a monk and lock you up with the Cistercians, under lock and key and behind a wall, and that, I trust, you would prefer to avoid. In any case, I won't be able to get you to Hungary. The one I recommend to you, can. He will ensure your safety, and if need be, defend you. He is a man of rather controversial nature, often unpleasant in manner, but you must endure him, for in certain matters he is irreplaceable. So remember: Strzegom, the monastery of the Brothers of the Order of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel, outside the city walls, by the road to the Świdnica Gate. Have you memorized it?"
"Yes, venerable father."
"You will set off without delay. Too many people have seen you in Strzelin anyway. You'll get the letter right away and off you go."
Reynevan sighed. He had sincerely intended to chat somewhere over a beer with Urban Horn. Horn inspired great esteem and admiration in Reynevan, and together with his dog Beelzebub, he was growing in his eyes to at least the stature of Sir Yvain with the Lion. Reynevan was very tempted to make Horn a certain proposition, concerning a matter of precisely knightly character – the joint liberation of a certain oppressed damsel. He also thought of saying goodbye to Dorota Faber. But alas, one does not treat lightly the advice and instructions of men like Canon Otto Beess.
"Father Otto?"
"Yes?"
"Who is this man from the Strzegom Carmelites?"
Otto Beess was silent for a moment.
"Someone," he said at last, "for whom nothing is impossible."


**Chapter 8**
in which, at first,
it is beautiful.
And later, not so much.

Reynevan was cheerful and happy. Joy filled him, and everything around him delighted with its beauty. Beautiful was the valley of the Upper Oława, cutting its meanders into the green hills. Beautifully trotted the stocky bay colt, a gift from Canon Otto Beess, along the road running beside the river. Wonderfully sang the thrushes among the trees, even more wonderfully the larks among the meadows. Bees, beetles, and horseflies buzzed atmospherically. A zephyr blowing from the hills brought intoxicating scents—now jasmine, now bird cherry. Now shit—human settlements were evidently nearby.
Reynevan was cheerful and happy. He had reasons.
He had not managed, despite his efforts, to meet or bid farewell to his recent travel companions; he regretted this, especially the mysterious disappearance of Urban Horn, which disappointed him greatly. But it was precisely the memory of Horn that inspired him to act.
In addition to the bay colt with a white blaze on its forehead, Canon Otto had also gifted him a purse for the road, and a much heavier one than the small pouch received a week earlier from Konrad Kantner. Weighing the purse in his hand and guessing from its weight no less than thirty Prague groschen inside, Reynevan was once again convinced of the superiority of the clerical estate over the knightly.
That purse changed his fate.
In one of the Strzelin inns, which he visited in search of Horn, he encountered the canon's factotum, Father Felicjan, greedily eating thick slices of fried sausage from a trencher and washing down the grease with heavy local beer. Reynevan knew at once what needed to be done. And he didn't even have to try too hard. The little priest licked his lips at the sight of the purse, and Reynevan handed it to him without a shadow of regret. And without counting how much was actually in it. Of course, he immediately obtained all the necessary information. Father Felicjan told him everything, indeed, he was ready to reveal a few additional secrets overheard in confession, but Reynevan politely refused, as the names of the penitents meant nothing to him, and their sins and peccadilloes did not interest him at all.
He rode out of Strzelin in the morning. With practically not a penny to his name. But cheerful and happy.
He was riding, however, by no means where the canon had told him to go. Not along the main road, westward, through the Oak Mountains, along the southern foot of Radunia, towards Świdnica and Strzegom. Quite contrary to the categorical prohibition, turning his back on the Radunia and Ślęża massifs, Reynevan rode south, up the Oława, along the road leading to Henryków and Ziębice.
He straightened in the saddle, his nostrils catching more pleasant scents carried by the wind. The little birds sang, the sun warmed. Oh, how beautiful the whole world was. Reynevan felt like shouting with joy.
Beautiful Adela, Gelfrad's wife, Father Felicjan had revealed to him in exchange for the purse weighing about thirty groschen, although seemingly cornered by her Stercz brothers-in-law in the Cistercian convent in Ligota, had managed to escape and throw off her pursuers. She had fled to Ziębice, to hide there in the Poor Clares' convent. True, the little priest recounted, licking his trencher, true, that Duke Jan of Ziębice, upon learning of this, had sternly ordered the nuns to hand over his vassal's wife. He had placed her under house arrest until the matter of the alleged adultery was clarified. But, here Father Felicjan let out a healthy, beery belch, although sin calls for punishment, the woman is safe in Ziębice, no longer threatened by the Sterczas' vigilante violence or harm. Duke Jan, here Father Felicjan blew his nose, had emphatically warned Apecz Stercza, indeed, had wagged his finger at him during an audience. No, the Sterczas would no longer be able to do any harm to their sister-in-law. Not in their power.
Reynevan urged the bay through a meadow yellow with mullein and purple with lupine. He wanted to laugh and shout with joy. Adela, his Adela, had thumbed her nose at the Sterczas, made fools and buffoons of them, duped them. They thought they had cornered her in Ligota, and she—slip! And that was the last they saw of her. Oh, how Wittich must have fumed, how Morold must have raged and hurled helpless blasphemies, how Wolfher must have been apoplectic! And Adela, in a flash, into the night, on a grey mare, with her braid flying…
Wait, he reflected. Adela doesn't wear a braid.
I must control myself, he thought soberly, urging the colt on. Nikoletta, the amazon with a braid as fair as straw, means nothing to me after all. Yes, she saved me, drew off the pursuit, I'll repay her for that when the opportunity arises. Indeed, I'll fall at her feet. But I love Adela and only Adela, Adela is the mistress of my heart and my thoughts, I think only of Adela, I'm not at all preoccupied by that fair braid, nor that blue gaze from under the sable kolpak, nor those raspberry lips, nor those shapely thighs, embracing the flanks of the grey mare…
I love Adela. Adela, from whom only about three miles separate me. If I let the horse gallop, I would be at the Ziębice gates before noon struck.
Calmly, calmly. Without fervour. With a cool head. First, taking advantage of the fact that it's on the way, I must visit my brother. When I free Adela from ducal arrest in Ziębice, we will both flee to Bohemia or Hungary. I may never see Peterlin again. I must say goodbye to him, explain. Ask for a brotherly blessing.
Canon Otto forbade it. Canon Otto ordered me to be like a wolf, never to take frequented paths. Canon Otto warned that the pursuit might be lurking near Peterlin's dwelling…
But Reynevan had a way for that too.
A tributary flowed into the Oława, a small river, more like a stream, hidden among the rushes, barely visible under a canopy of alders. Reynevan headed up this stream. He knew the way. A way that led not to Balbinów, where Peterlin lived, but to Powojowice, where he worked.
The first sign that Powojowice was near came after some time from that very stream, along whose bank Reynevan was travelling. The stream first began to stink, at first lightly, then more strongly, then downright terribly. At the same time, the water changed colour, and radically so—to a dirty red. Reynevan rode out of the forest and from a distance already saw the cause—huge wooden drying racks, from which hung dyed pieces of linen and bolts of cloth. Red predominated—the daily production already signalled by the stream—but there were also blue, dark blue, and green fabrics.
Reynevan knew these colours, now more associated with Piotr von Bielau than with the tinctures of the family crest. Besides, he had some part in these colours himself, having helped his brother obtain dyes. The deep, vivid red of the cloths and linens dyed at Peterlin's came from a secret composition of kermes, viper's bugloss, and madder. Peterlin obtained all shades of blue by mixing blueberry juice with woad, which, incidentally, he cultivated himself—one of the few in Silesia. Woad mixed with saffron and safflower produced a beautiful, intense green.
The wind blew in his direction, bringing a stench that made his eyes water and the hairs in his nostrils curl. The dyeing components, bleaches, lyes, acids, potash, clays, ashes, and tallows were sufficiently foul-smelling; spoiled whey, in which—according to Flemish recipes—linen cloth was soaked in the final stage of the bleaching process, also smelled quite bad. None of this, however, compared to the odour of the basic agent used in Powojowice—stale human urine. The urine, which had been aged in large vats for about two weeks, was then used copiously in the fulling mill, for felting cloth. The effect was that the Powojowice fulling mill and its surroundings stank of piss like high heaven, and with favourable winds, the stench could reach as far as the Cistercian monastery in Henryków.
Reynevan rode along the bank of the red and latrine-stinking stream. He could already hear the fulling mill—the incessant clatter of water-driven wheels, the clanking and creaking of gears, the grinding of transmissions; soon, a deep, earth-shaking thud overlaid everything—the beating of the fulling stocks, pounding the cloth in the troughs. Peterlin's fulling mill was modern; besides several traditional stations with stocks, it also had water-powered hammers that felted faster, better, and more evenly. And louder.
Down by the stream, beyond further drying racks and a row of dye pits, he saw the buildings, sheds, and roofing of the fulling mill. As usual, a good twenty wagons of various sizes and constructions stood there. Reynevan knew that these were wagons of both suppliers—Peterlin imported large quantities of potash from Poland—and weavers, bringing cloth for felting. The reputation of Powojowice meant that weavers came here from all over the area, from Niemcza, Ziębice, Strzelin, Grodków, even Frankenstein. He saw master weavers, crowding around the fulling mill and supervising the work, he heard their shouts, audible even above the din of the machinery. As usual, they were arguing with the fullers about the way the cloth was arranged and turned in the stocks. He noticed among them several monks in white habits with black scapulars; this too was nothing new, the Henryków Cistercian monastery produced considerable quantities of cloth and was a regular customer of Peterlin's.
The one Reynevan did not see, however, was Peterlin himself. His brother, who was usually very visible in Powojowice, was accustomed to riding around the entire area. On horseback, to distinguish himself. Piotr von Bielau was, after all, a knight.
What was stranger, nowhere could the thin and tall figure of Nicodemus Verbruggen be seen, the Fleming from Ghent, the great master of fulling and dyeing.
Remembering the canon's warnings in time, Reynevan rode into the buildings stealthily, behind the wagons of other arriving customers. He pulled his hat down over his nose, hunched in the saddle. Without attracting anyone's attention, he rode up to Peterlin's house.
The usually bustling and crowded building seemed completely empty. No one reacted to his shout, no one was interested in the slamming of the door. There wasn't a living soul in the long hallway or in the servants' quarters. He entered the main room.
Master Nicodemus Verbruggen, grey-haired, shorn like a peasant but dressed like a gentleman, sat on the floor in front of the hearth. The chimney roared with fire. The Fleming was tearing and throwing sheets of paper into the flames. He was almost finished. He had only a few sheets left on his lap, while a whole pile was blackening and curling in the fire.
"Master Verbruggen!"
"Jesus Christus…" The Fleming raised his head, threw another sheet into the fire. "Jesus Christus, young Master Reinmar… What a misfortune, young master… What a terrible misfortune…"
"What misfortune, master? Where is my brother? What are you burning here?"
"Mynheer Peter ordered it. He said, if anything should happen, take it from the hiding place, burn it, and quickly. Thus he said: 'If anything, Nicodemus, God forbid, should happen, burn it quickly. And the fulling mill must keep working.' Thus said Mynheer Peter. En het woord is vlees geworden…"
"Master Verbruggen…" Reynevan felt a terrible premonition raise the hairs on the back of his neck. "Master Verbruggen, speak! What are these documents? And what word became flesh?"
The Fleming drew his head into his shoulders, threw the last sheet into the hearth. Reynevan rushed over, burning his hand as he pulled it from the fire, waving it to extinguish the flames. Partially.
"Speak!"
"They killed him," Nicodemus Verbruggen said hollowly. Reynevan saw a tear meandering down the cheek bristling with grey stubble. "Good Mynheer Peter is dead. They killed him. Murdered him. Young Master Reinmar… Such a misfortune, Jesus Christus, such a misfortune…"
The door slammed. The Fleming looked around and realized that no one had heard his last words.

***

Peterlin's face was white. And porous. Like cheese. In the corner of his mouth, despite washing, traces of clotted blood remained.
The elder von Bielau lay on a bier set in the middle of the common room, amidst twelve burning candles. Two Hungarian gold ducats had been placed on his eyes, and spruce twigs were tucked under his head, their scent, mixing with the smell of melting wax, filling the common room with a sickening, repulsive, funereal stench of death.
The bier was covered with red cloth. Dyed with kermes in his own dye-works, Reynevan thought absurdly, feeling tears welling in his eyes.
"How…" he choked out from his constricted throat. "How… could this… have happened?"
Gryzelda z Derów, Peterlin's wife, looked at him. Her face was red and swollen from crying, she pressed both sobbing children, Tomaszek and Sybilla, to her skirts. But her gaze was unkind, downright malevolent. Peterlin's father-in-law and brother-in-law, old Walpot Der and his blocky son Krystian, also looked at him none too kindly.
No one, neither Gryzelda nor the Ders, deigned to answer his question. But Reynevan had no intention of giving up.
"What happened? Will someone finally tell me?"
"Some men killed him," muttered Peterlin's neighbour, Gunter von Bischofsheim.
"God," added the parish priest from Wawolnica, Reynevan didn't remember his name, "God will punish them for this."
"They stabbed him with a sword," said Matjas Wirt, a local leaseholder, hoarsely. "The horse came back riderless. At high noon."
"At high noon," repeated the Wawolnica priest, folding his hands. "Ab incursu et daemone meridiano libera nos, Domine…"
"The horse came back," Wirt repeated, slightly thrown off by the prayerful interjection, "with a bloodied saddle and caparison. So we started searching and found him. In the forest, just before Balbinów… Right by the road. Master Piotr must have been riding from Powojowice. The ground there was torn up by many hooves, it's clear they surrounded him in a group…"
"Who?"
"We don't know," Matjas Wirt shrugged. "Robbers, probably…"
"Robbers? The robbers didn't take the horse? Impossible."
"And who knows what's possible and what's not," von Bischofsheim shrugged. "Master Der's men and mine are chasing through the forests, maybe they'll catch someone. And we've informed the starosta. The starosta's men will come, they'll investigate, find out, cui bono. Meaning, who had reason for the murder and who benefited from it."
"Perhaps," Walpot von Der spoke venomously, "some moneylender, angry about an unpaid usurious debt? Perhaps some fellow dyer, glad to be rid of a competitor? Perhaps some client, cheated out of three measly groschen? That's how it is, that's how it ends, when one forgets one's birth and consorts with commoners. Plays at being a merchant. He who lies down with dogs, gets up with fleas. Ptooey! I gave you to a knight, daughter, and now you're a widow to a…"
He fell silent suddenly, and Reynevan realized it was under his gaze. Despair and rage fought fiercely within him, first one gaining the upper hand, then the other. He controlled himself with the last of his willpower, but his hands trembled. His voice too.
"Were there not seen nearby," he choked out, "four horsemen? Armed? One tall, moustached, in a studded jacket… One small, with pockmarks on his face…"
"There were such men," the priest spoke unexpectedly. "Yesterday, in Wawolnica, by the church. The Angelus was just ringing… Oh, they looked like grim cutthroats. Four of them. Truly, the horsemen of the Apocalypse…"
"I knew it!" Gryzelda shrieked in a voice hoarse and raw from crying, fixing Reynevan with a basilisk-like stare. "I knew it, the moment I saw you, you scoundrel! It's because of you! Because of your sins and deeds!"
"The other von Bielau," Walpot Der mockingly emphasized the title. "Also a nobleman. This one, for a change, deals in leeches and enemas."
"Scoundrel, good-for-nothing!" Gryzelda screamed louder and louder. "Whoever murdered these children's father, came here following your trail! Misfortune only comes through you! You always brought your brother nothing but shame and sorrow! What do you want here? Does the inheritance already smell good to you, you vulture? Get out! Get out of my house!"
Reynevan, with great effort, controlled the trembling of his hands. But he could not utter a sound. He was seething internally with passion and fury, so much so that he was shaken by the urge to scream in all the Ders' faces what he thought of their entire family, who could play lords only thanks to the money Peterlin earned in the fulling mill. But he restrained himself. Peterlin was dead. He lay murdered, with Hungarian ducats on his eyes, in the common room of his own small keep, amidst smoking candles, on a bier, on red cloth.
Peterlin was dead. Quarrels and bickering were unseemly, repulsive, by his corpse; the very thought of it was loathsome. Reynevan was also afraid that as soon as he opened his mouth, he would burst into sobs.
He left without a word.
Mourning and gloom hung over the entire Balbinów keep. It was empty and quiet; the servants had hidden somewhere, aware that it was not good to get under the feet of mourners lost in grief. Even the dogs weren't barking. No dogs were visible at all. Except…
He rubbed his eyes, still filled with tears. The black mastiff sitting between the stable and the bathhouse was no apparition. It had no intention of disappearing.
Reynevan quickly crossed the courtyard, entered the building from the side of the wagon shed. He walked along the trough for the cows—the building was both a cowshed and a pigsty—and reached the horse stalls. In the corner of the stall usually occupied by Peterlin's horse, picking at the clay of the threshing floor with a knife, knelt Urban Horn amidst cleared straw.
"What you are looking for is not here," Reynevan said, surprised at his own calmness. Horn, surprisingly, did not seem at all taken aback. He looked him in the eyes, without getting up.
"What you are looking for was hidden in another cache. But it's gone now. It burned."
"Indeed?"
"Indeed." Reynevan pulled a charred fragment of a sheet from his pocket, threw it carelessly onto the clay floor. Horn still didn't get up.
"Who killed Peterlin?" Reynevan took a step. "Kunz Aulock and his band on Stercz's orders? Did they kill Master Bart of Karczyn too? What do you have to do with this, Horn? Why are you here, in Balbinów, barely half a day after my brother's death? How do you know his hiding place? Why are you looking for documents in it that burned in Powojowice? And what were those documents?"
"Flee from here, Reinmar," Urban Horn said, drawing out the words. "Flee from here, if you value your life. Don't even wait for your brother's burial."
"First, you will answer my questions. Start with the most important one: what connects you to this murder? What connects you to Kunz Aulock? Don't try to lie!"
"I will not try," Horn replied, not averting his gaze, "either to lie or to answer. For your own good, by the way. It may surprise you, but that is the truth."
"I will force you to answer." Reynevan took a step and drew his dagger. "I will force you, Horn. If necessary, by force."
That Horn whistled was indicated only by the pursing of his lips; the sound was inaudible. But only to Reynevan. For in the next moment, something struck him in the chest with terrible force. He fell onto the clay floor. Crushed by the weight, he opened his eyes, only to see a full set of the black mastiff Beelzebub's fangs right in front of his nose. The dog's saliva dripped onto his face, the stench made him nauseous. A sinister, guttural growl paralyzed him with fear. Urban Horn appeared in his field of vision, tucking the charred paper into his tunic.
"You can't force me to do anything, boy." Horn adjusted the chaperon on his head. "But you will listen to what I tell you out of goodwill. Indeed, out of kindness. Beelzebub, don't move."
Beelzebub didn't move. Though it was clear he had a great urge to.
"Out of kindness," Horn repeated, "I advise you then, Reinmar: flee. Disappear. Listen to Canon Beess's advice. For I'll wager my head that he gave you advice, gave you instructions on how to extricate yourself from the trouble you've fallen into. One does not disregard, boy, the instructions and orders of men like Canon Beess. Beelzebub, don't move."
"About your brother," Urban Horn said, "I am exceedingly sorry. You don't know how much. Farewell. And beware."
When Reynevan opened his eyes, squeezed shut against Beelzebub's muzzle almost touching his face, neither the dog nor Horn was in the barn.

***

Crouching on his brother's grave, Reynevan shrank and trembled with fear. He sprinkled salt mixed with hazel ash around himself and, in a trembling voice, repeated the incantation. Believing less and less in its effectiveness.
Wirfe saltze, wirfe saltze
Non timebis a timore nocturno
Neither moru, nor guest from the darkness
Nor demon
Wirfe saltze, wirfe saltze…
Monsters swirled and clamoured in the gloom.
Though aware of the risk and the time lost, Reynevan waited for his brother's burial. Despite the efforts of his sister-in-law and her family, he did not allow himself to be discouraged from keeping vigil by the corpse, he took part in the exequies, listened to the Mass. He was there when, in the presence of the sobbing Gryzelda, the parish priest, and a small funeral procession, Peterlin was buried in a grave in the cemetery behind the ancient little church of Wawolnica.
Only then did he leave. That is to say—he pretended to leave.
When darkness fell, Reynevan hurried to the cemetery. He arranged his magical instruments on the fresh grave, assembled—surprisingly—without any particular trouble. The oldest part of the Wawolnica necropolis adjoined a ravine washed out by a small river; the ground had subsided there somewhat, so access to the ancient graves presented no difficulty. Thus, Reynevan's magical arsenal even included a coffin nail and a corpse's finger.
However, neither the corpse's finger, nor the monkshood, sage, and chrysanthemum picked from under the cemetery fence, nor the incantations whispered over the ideogram carved on the grave with a crooked coffin nail, helped. Peterlin's spirit, contrary to the assurances of magical books, did not rise above the grave in ethereal form. It did not speak. It gave no sign.
If I had my books here, Reynevan thought, disappointed and discouraged by numerous attempts. If I had the Lemegeton or the Necronomicon… A Venetian crystal… A bit of mandrake… If I had access to an alembic and could distil an elixir… If I…
Unfortunately. The grimoires, crystal, mandrake, and alembic were far away, in Oleśnica. In the Augustinian monastery. Or, more likely, in the possession of the Inquisition.
A storm was rapidly approaching from behind the horizon. The rumbles of thunder accompanying the flashes of lightning in the sky grew louder. The wind died down completely, the air became dead and heavy as a shroud. It must have been close to midnight.
And then it began.
Another lightning flash illuminated the church. Reynevan saw with terror that the entire bell tower was swarming with spider-like creatures, crawling up and down. Before his eyes, several cemetery crosses moved and tilted, one of the further graves bulged strongly. From the darkness over the ravine came the crunch of breaking coffin boards, then loud smacking sounds. And then howling.
As he sprinkled salt around himself, his hands flew as if in an attack of fever, and his lips could barely be forced to babble the formula of the spell.
The greatest activity was over the ravine, in the oldest, alder-overgrown part of the cemetery. Fortunately, Reynevan did not see what was happening there; even the lightning flashes revealed nothing from the darkness beyond indistinct shapes and silhouettes. However, his hearing provided strong sensations—the company bustling among the old graves stomped, roared, howled, whistled, cursed, and on top of that, clacked and gnashed its teeth.
Wirfe saltze, wirfe saltze…
A woman laughed thinly and spasmodically. Some baritone maliciously parodied the liturgy of the Mass, accompanied by the wild cackling of the others. Someone was beating a drum.
A skeleton emerged from the darkness. It spun around a bit, then sat on a grave and sat there, holding its bowed skull in its bony hands. After a moment, a hairy creature with huge feet sat down next to it. The creature began to scratch these feet vigorously, groaning and moaning as it did so. The pensive skeleton paid it no attention.
A toadstool on spider legs passed by, followed shortly by something that looked exactly like a pelican, but instead of feathers it had scales, and its beak was full of pointed fangs.
A large frog jumped onto a neighbouring grave.
And there was something else there. Something that—Reynevan would have sworn—was constantly watching him, never taking its eyes off him. Something completely hidden in the darkness, invisible even in the flash of lightning. But a careful gaze could discern eyes glowing like rotten wood. And long teeth.
"Wirfe saltze," he sprinkled the rapidly dwindling salt before him. "Wirfe saltze…"
Suddenly, a bright, slowly moving patch caught his eye. He followed it, waiting for the next lightning flash. When it flashed, he saw to his astonishment a girl in a white shift, picking and placing large, spreading cemetery nettles into a basket. The girl saw him too. After a moment's hesitation, she approached, set down her basket. She paid not the slightest attention either to the pensive skeleton or to the hairy creature, picking between the toes of its large feet.
"For pleasure?" she asked. "Or out of duty?"
"Err… Out of duty…" he overcame his fear, understood what she was asking. "Brother… My brother was killed. He lies here…"
"Aha," she brushed her hair from her forehead. "And I, you see, am gathering nettles here."
"To sew shirts," he sighed after a moment, guessing. "For brothers enchanted into swans?"
She was silent for a long time.
"You are strange," she said at last. "The nettles are for cloth, of course. For shirts. But not for brothers. I have no brothers. And if I had, I would never let them wear these shirts."
She laughed gutturally, seeing his expression.
"Why are you even talking to him, Eliza?" spoke the toothed thing, invisible in the darkness. "Isn't it a waste of effort? Rain will fall before morning, wash away his salt. Then his head will be bitten off."
"That's not right," said the pensive skeleton, without raising its skull. "That's not right."
"Of course not," agreed the girl called Eliza. "After all, this is Toledo. One of us. And there are few of us left."
"He wanted to talk to the dead man," declared a dwarf with teeth protruding from under his upper lip, emerging as if from under the ground. He was plump as a pumpkin, his bare belly shining from under a too-short, frayed waistcoat.
"He wanted to talk to the dead man," he repeated. "To his brother, who lies buried here. He wanted answers to questions. But he didn't get them."
"Then it is fitting to help," said Eliza.
"Sure," said the skeleton.
"Sure, brekek," said the frog.
Lightning flashed, thunder rolled. The wind rose, rustled in the weeds, swirled and dusted with dry leaves. Eliza, without hesitation, stepped over the scattered salt, pushed Reynevan hard in the chest. He fell onto the grave, hit the back of his head on the cross. Light flashed in his eyes, then it grew dark, then it flashed again, but this time it was lightning. The earth beneath his back trembled. And spun.
Shadows danced around, dancing silhouettes, two circles, alternately swirling around Peterlin's grave.
"Barbelo, Hecate, Holda!"
"Magna Mater!"
"Eia!"
The ground beneath him swayed and tilted so steeply that Reynevan violently spread his arms to keep from sliding off and falling. His legs searched in vain for support. Yet he did not fall. Sounds, singing, invaded his ears. Visions pressed upon his eyes.
Veni, veni, venias
ne me mori, ne me mori facias!
Hyrca! Hyrca! Nazaza!
Trillirivos! Trillirivos! Trillirivos!
Adsumus, says Percival, kneeling before the Grail. Adsumus, repeats Moses, bent under the weight of the stone tablets brought down from Mount Sinai. Adsumus, says Jesus, falling under the cross. Adsumus, repeat the knights gathered at the table in one voice. Adsumus! Adsumus! We are here, Lord, gathered in Your name.
An echo runs through the castle like rumbling thunder, like the sound of a distant battle, like the crash of a battering ram against the castle gate. And slowly fades among the dark corridors.
Viator, the Wanderer, will come, says a young girl with a foxy face and dark-ringed eyes, adorned with a wreath of verbena and clover. Someone leaves, someone comes. Apage! Flumen immundissimum, draco maleficus… Do not ask the name, it is mysterious. From that which devours came forth that which is consumed, and from the strong came forth sweetness. And who is to blame? He who speaks the truth.
They will be gathered, imprisoned in a dungeon; they will be locked in prison, and after many years they will be punished. Beware the Wallcreeper, beware the bats, beware the demon that destroys at noon, and beware also him who walks in darkness. Love, says Hans Mein Igel, love will save your life. Do you regret it, asks the girl smelling of calamus and mint. Do you regret it? The girl is naked, naked with innocent nakedness, nuditas virtualis. She is barely visible in the darkness. But so close that one feels her warmth.
Sun, serpent, and fish. Serpent, fish, sun inscribed in a triangle. The Narrenturm collapses, turris fulgurata, the tower struck by lightning, crumbles into ruins. The poor fool falls from it, flies down, towards destruction. I am that fool, runs through Reynevan's head, fool and madman, it is I who fall, fly into the abyss, to the bottom.
A man, all in flames, running screaming through shallow snow. A church on fire.
He shook his head to dispel the visions. And then, in the flash of another lightning bolt, he saw Peterlin.
The apparition, motionless as a statue, suddenly shone with an unnatural light. Reynevan saw that this light, like sunlight through the hole-ridden walls of a hut, emanated from numerous wounds—in his chest, neck, and abdomen.
"God, Peterlin…" he moaned. "How terribly they… They will pay me for this, I swear! I will avenge you… I will avenge you, little brother… I swear it…"
The vision made a violent gesture. Clearly negative, forbidding. Yes, it was Peterlin, no one but his father gestured like that when he denied something or forbade something, when he scolded little Reynevan for mischief or mad ideas.
"Peterlin… Little brother…"
The same gesture, even sharper, more violent, more emphatic. Leaving no doubt.
A hand, pointing south.
"Flee," spoke the vision in the voice of Eliza of the nettles. "Flee, little one. Far away. As far as possible. Beyond the forests. Before the dungeon of Narrenturm consumes you. Flee, running through the mountains, leaping over the hills, saliens in montibus, transiliens colles."
The earth spun furiously. And everything ended. It fell into darkness.

***

At dawn, the rain woke him. He lay on his brother's grave on his back, motionless and numb, and the drops splattered on his face.

***

"Allow me, young man," said Otto Beess, canon of Saint John the Baptist, provost of the Wrocław chapter. "Allow me to briefly recapitulate what you have told me here, which has made me cease to believe my own ears. So, Konrad, Bishop of Wrocław, having the opportunity to get at the arses of the Sterczas, who sincerely hate him and whom he hates, does nothing. Having almost irrefutable proof that the Sterczas are involved in a family feud and murder, Bishop Konrad takes no action in the matter. Is that so?"
"Exactly so," replied Gwibert Bancz, secretary to the Bishop of Wrocław, a young cleric with a handsome face, clear complexion, and gentle, velvety eyes. "It is decided. No steps against the Stercz family. Not even reprimands. Not even interrogations. The Bishop decided this in the presence of His Reverence Suffragan Tylman. And in the presence of that knight to whom the investigation was entrusted. The one who arrived in Wrocław this morning."
"The knight," repeated the canon, gazing at a painting depicting the martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew, the only decoration, apart from a shelf with candlesticks and a crucifix, on the bare walls of the room. "The knight who arrived in Wrocław this morning."
Gwibert Bancz swallowed. The situation, to put it mildly, was not the most convenient for him. It never had been. And there was no indication that it might ever change.
"Precisely," Otto Beess drummed his fingers on the table, seemingly focused exclusively on the saint being tortured by the Armenians. "Precisely. What knight is this, son? Name? Family? Coat of arms?"
"Ahem…" coughed the cleric. "Neither name was mentioned, nor family… Nor did he bear a coat of arms, being dressed entirely in black. But I have seen him with the bishop before."
"What does he look like then? Don't make me drag it out of you."
"Not old. Tall, slim… Black hair to his shoulders. Long nose, like a beak… And his gaze is somewhat… bird-like… Piercing… In summa, he could hardly be called handsome… But masculine…"
Gwibert Bancz broke off suddenly. The canon did not turn his head, did not even stop drumming his fingers. He knew the cleric's secret erotic preferences. Knowing them had allowed him to make him his informant.
"Continue."
"So it was this very knightly visitor, who, incidentally, showed neither humility nor even the slightest embarrassment in the bishop's presence, who reported on the investigation into the murders of Masters Bart of Karczyn and Piotr von Bielau. And this report was such that His Reverence the Suffragan could not contain himself at a certain point and began to laugh…"
Otto Beess raised his eyebrows without a word.
"The said knight declared that the Jews were to blame, because in the vicinity of both crime scenes, one could detect the foetor judaica, the stench peculiar to Jews… To get rid of this odour, the Jews, as everyone knows, drink Christian blood. The murder, the visitor continued, paying no heed to the fact that the Reverend Tylman was laughing himself silly, thus bears the hallmarks of a ritual killing, and the culprits should be sought in the nearest kahals, especially the one in Brzeg, because the rabbi from Brzeg was seen in the vicinity of Strzelin, and in the company of young Reinmar de Bielau… The one Your Reverence knows of…"
"I know. Continue."
"At such a dictum, the Reverend Suffragan Tylman declared that it was a fairy tale, that both murdered men had fallen to swords. That a man like Albrecht von Bart was a strongman and a renowned fencer. That no rabbi, from Brzeg or anywhere else, could have stood up to Master Bart even if they had fought with Talmuds. And again he began to laugh to tears."
"And the knight?"
"He said that if the Jews did not kill the good Masters Bart and Piotr de Bielau, then the devil must have done it. Which amounts to the same thing."
"What did Bishop Konrad say to that?"
"His Eminence," the cleric cleared his throat, "gazed thunderously at the Reverend Tylman, clearly displeased with his merriment. And he spoke at once. Very sternly, seriously, and officially, and ordered me to write it down…"
"He dismissed the investigation," the canon anticipated, pronouncing the words very slowly. "He simply dismissed the investigation."
"As if you were there. And the Reverend Suffragan Tylman sat and said not a word, but he had a strange expression. Bishop Konrad noticed this and said, angrily, that right was on his side, history would attest to it, and that it was ad maiorem Dei gloriam."
"He said that?"
"In those very words. Therefore, Reverend Father, do not go to the bishop in this matter. I assure you, you will achieve nothing. Moreover…"
"Moreover, what?"
"The said visitor told the bishop that if anyone invoked, petitioned, or demanded further investigation into the matters of both crimes, he demanded to be informed of it."
"He demands," Otto Beess repeated. "And what did the bishop say to that?"
"He nodded his head."
"He nodded his head," the canon repeated, also nodding. "Well, well. Konrad, Piast of Oleśnica. Nodded his head."
"He nodded, Reverend Father."
Otto Beess looked again at the painting, at the tortured Bartholomew, from whom the Armenians were tearing long strips of skin with huge pincers. If one were to believe the Golden Legend of Jacobus da Voragine, he thought, a wondrous scent of roses hung over the place of martyrdom. Right. Agony stinks. A stench, a reek, an odour hangs over all places of execution and torment. Also over Golgotha. There too, I'll wager my head, there were no roses. There was, how aptly, foetor judaica.
"Please, boy. Take it."
The cleric, as usual, first reached for the purse, then abruptly withdrew his hand, as if the canon were handing him a scorpion.
"Reverend Father…" he stammered. "But I don't… Not for paltry coin… Only because…"
"Take it, son, take it," the canon interrupted with a patronizing smile. "I have told you on other occasions that an informant must take payment. Those who inform for free are despised above all. For an idea. Out of fear. Out of anger and envy. I have told you before: Judas deserved contempt more for betraying cheaply than for the betrayal itself."

***

The afternoon was fair and warm, a pleasant change after several days of sleet. The tower of St. Mary Magdalene's Church gleamed in the sun, as did the roofs of the little townhouses. Gwibert Bancz stretched. He had grown cold at the canon's. The room was shaded, a chill emanated from the walls.
Besides his residence in the chapter house on Ostrów Tumski, Provost Otto Beess had a house in Wrocław on Szewska Street, near the market square; there he was accustomed to receiving those whose visits were not to be spoken of loudly, including, of course, Gwibert Bancz. Gwibert Bancz therefore decided to take advantage of the opportunity. He did not want to return to Ostrów; it was unlikely that the bishop would need him before vespers. And from Szewska it was three steps to a certain cellar known to the cleric behind Kurzy Targ. In the cellar, one could spend part of the money received from the canon. Gwibert Bancz devoutly believed that by getting rid of money, he was getting rid of sin.
Nibbling on a pretzel bought at a passing stall, he turned into a narrow alley to shorten his way. It was quiet and deserted here, so deserted that rats, astonished by the appearance of a human, scurried from under his feet.
He heard the rustle of feathers and the flapping of wings. He looked around and saw a large wallcreeper, clumsily alighting on the frieze above a bricked-up window. He dropped the pretzel, recoiled abruptly, jumped back.
Before his eyes, the bird slid down the wall, its claws scrabbling. It blurred. Grew. And changed shape. Bancz wanted to scream, but could not force a sound from his constricted throat.
Where the wallcreeper had been a moment before, now stood the knight known to the cleric. Tall, slim, black-haired, dressed in black, with a piercing bird-like gaze.
Bancz again opened his mouth and again produced nothing but a quiet croak. The Wallcreeper Knight approached sinuously. Being very close, he smiled, winked, and pursed his lips, blowing the cleric a very erotic kiss.
Before the cleric understood what was happening, he caught the gleam of a blade, was struck in the stomach, blood gushed onto his thighs. He was struck a second time, in the side, the knife crunched on his ribs. He hit his back against the wall, a third blow almost pinned him to it.
Now he could scream and would have screamed, but he didn't have time.
The Wallcreeper lunged and with a wide slash slit his throat.

***

Beggars found the crumpled corpse lying in a black puddle. Before the town guard arrived, merchants and market women from Kurzy Targ also ran up.
A sense of dread hung over the crime scene. A terrible, suffocating, gut-wrenching dread. A dreadful dread.
So dreadful that until the arrival of the guard, no one dared to steal the purse of money protruding from the murdered man's knife-slashed mouth.

***

"Gloria in excelsis Deo," intoned Canon Otto Beess, lowering his clasped hands and bowing his head before the altar. "Et in terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis…"
The deacons stood at his sides, joining in the singing in hushed voices. Otto Beess, provost of the Wrocław chapter, celebrating Mass, continued. He continued mechanically, routinely. His thoughts were elsewhere.
Laudamus te, benedicimus te, adoramus te,
glorificamus te, gratias agimus tibi…
They murdered the cleric Gwibert Bancz. In broad daylight, in the centre of Wrocław. And Bishop Konrad, who dismissed the investigation into the murder of Peterlin von Bielau, will probably dismiss the investigation into his secretary's murder as well. I don't know what's happening here. But I must ensure my own safety. Never, under any circumstances, give a pretext or opportunity. And not be taken by surprise.
The singing rose to the high vault of the Wrocław cathedral.
Agnus Dei, Filius Patris, qui tollis peccata mundi,
miserere nobis;
Qui tollis peccata mundi, suscipe deprecationem
nostram…
Otto Beess knelt before the altar.
I hope, he thought, making the sign of the cross, I hope Reynevan made it… That he is safe now. I very much hope…
"Miserere nobis…"
The Mass continued.

***

Four horsemen galloped through the crossroads, past a stone cross, one of the many memorials to crime and remorse in Silesia. The wind lashed, the rain cut, mud splattered from under hooves. Kunz Aulock, known as Kyrieleison, cursed, wiping water from his face with a wet gauntlet. Stork of Gorgowice echoed him from under his dripping hood even more profanely. Walter de Barby and Sybek of Kobylagłowa didn't even feel like cursing anymore. At a gallop, they thought, just to get under some roof, to some inn, to warmth, dryness, and mulled beer.
Mud splashed from under the hooves, muddying the already mud-caked figure huddled under the cross and covered with a cloak. None of the riders paid any attention to the figure.
Reynevan didn't even raise his head.

**Chapter 9**
in which Szarlej appears.

The prior of the Strzegom Carmelite monastery was as thin as a skeleton; his complexion, dry skin, imperfectly shaven stubble, and long nose made him resemble a plucked heron. When he looked at Reynevan, he squinted; when he returned to reading Otto Beess's letter, he brought the letter to within two inches of his nose. His bony, cyanotic hands trembled incessantly, and his mouth twisted in pain from time to time. The prior was by no means an old man. It was an illness that Reynevan knew and had seen, an illness that consumed like leprosy—only invisibly, from within. An illness against which all medicines and herbs were powerless, for which only the strongest magic was effective. What good was it, anyway, that it was effective. Even if someone knew how to treat it, they wouldn't, because the times were such that a cured patient could denounce the healer.
The prior's cough brought him out of his reverie.
"So, it was only for this very thing," he raised the Wrocław canon's letter, "that you waited for my return, young man? For four whole days? Knowing that Father Guardian has full powers during my absence?"
Reynevan confined himself to a nod. Citing the condition of handing the letter personally to the prior was so trivially obvious as to be unworthy of mention. As for the four days spent in the village near Strzegom, they too were not worth mentioning—they had passed without him noticing. As if in a dream. Since the tragedy in Balbinów, Reynevan had still been as if in a dream. Numb, distracted, and semi-conscious.
"You waited," the prior stated the fact, "to deliver the letter into my own hands. And you know what, young man? It is very good that you waited."
Reynevan did not comment this time either. The prior returned to the letter, holding it almost to his nose.
"Yeees," he finally said drawlingly, raising his eyes and squinting. "I knew the day would come when the venerable canon would remind me of my debt. And demand repayment. With usurious interest. Which, incidentally, the Church forbids charging. For the Gospel of Luke says: lend, expecting nothing in return. Do you believe, young man, without reservation, in what the Church, our mother, bids us believe?"
"Yes, Reverend Father."
"A praiseworthy virtue. Especially in these times. Especially in a place like this. Do you know where you are? Do you know what this place is? Besides a monastery?"
"You don't know," the prior guessed from his silence. "Or you skilfully pretend not to know. This is, you see, a house of demerits. What a house of demerits is, you probably don't know either, or you will pretend with equal skill that you don't know. So I will tell you: it is a prison."
The prior fell silent, clasped his hands, looked at his interlocutor searchingly. Reynevan, it goes without saying, had long since guessed what it was all about, but he did not betray himself. He did not want to spoil the Carmelite's pleasure, which this way of conducting conversation evidently afforded him.
"Do you know," the monk resumed after a moment, "what His Reverence the Canon allows himself to ask of me in this letter?"
"No, Reverend Father."
"This ignorance somewhat excuses you. And since I know, nothing can excuse me. Thus, if I refuse the request, my action will be justified. What do you say to that? Is my logic not equal to Aristotle's?"
Reynevan did not answer. The prior was silent. For a very long time. Then he lit the canon's letter from a candle, turned it so that the flame flared up, and threw it onto the floor. Reynevan watched as the paper curled, blackened, and crumbled. Here turn to ash my hopes, he thought. Untimely, moreover, senseless and futile. Perhaps it is better then, that it happened as it did.
The prior stood up.
"Go to the cellarer," he said briefly and dryly. "Let him feed you and give you drink. Then you will betake yourself to our church. There you will meet him with whom you should. Orders will be given, you will be able to leave the monastery without hindrance. Canon Beess emphasized in his letter that you are both embarking on a long journey. I will add from myself that it is very good that it is a long one. It would be, I add, a great mistake to travel too close. And to return too soon."
"Thank you, Your Reverence…"
"Do not thank me. And if either of you should have the thought of asking me for a blessing for the road before departing, let him abandon that thought."

***

The victuals at the Strzegom Carmelites were, in truth, truly prison-like. Reynevan, however, was still too dejected and apathetic to taste them. Besides, to be frank, he was too hungry to grimace at salted herring, unseasoned porridge, and beer that differed from water only in colour, and even then, not significantly. Or perhaps it was a fast day? He didn't remember.
So he ate briskly and lively, which the elderly cellarer watched with evident satisfaction, undoubtedly accustomed to much less enthusiasm from those he hosted. Reynevan had barely dealt with the small jug when the smiling monk offered him a second, taken straight from the barrel—Reynevan decided to take advantage of this act of friendship.
"A veritable fortress, your monastery," he said with his mouth full. "And no wonder, I know what it serves for. But surely you have no armed guard. Has no one ever escaped from those who do penance here?"
"Oh, son, son," the cellarer shook his head at his naive obtuseness. "Escape? And for what? Do not forget who does penance here. For each of them, penance will end someday. And though no one here does penance pro nihilo, the end of penance erases the guilt. Nullum crimen, everything returns to normal. And an escapee? He would be an outlaw to the end of his days."
"I understand."
"That's good, because I'm not allowed to talk about it. More porridge?"
"Gladly. And those penitents, what, out of curiosity, are they doing penance for? For what transgressions?"
"I'm not allowed to talk about that."
"But I'm not asking about specific cases. Just generally."
The cellarer coughed and looked around fearfully, undoubtedly aware that in a house of demerits, even the kitchen walls, hung with pans and garlic, might have ears.
"Oh," he said quietly, wiping his grease-stained hands on his habit. "They do penance here for various things, son, for various things. Mostly wayward priests. And monks. Those for whom their vows were too burdensome. You can imagine: vows of obedience, humility, poverty… Also abstinence and moderation… As they say: plus bibere, quam orare. Also the vow of chastity, unfortunately…"
"Femina," Reynevan guessed, "instrumentum diaboli?"
"If only femina…" sighed the cellarer, raising his eyes. "Ah, ah… An immensity of sins, an immensity… No denying it. And we have more serious matters here… Oh, more serious… But I'm not allowed to talk about that. Have you finished eating, son?"
"I have finished. Thank you. It was tasty."
"Come by whenever you wish."

The interior of the church was exceptionally gloomy; the glow of candles and the light from the narrow little windows fell only on the area around the altar itself, the tabernacle, the crucifix, and the triptych depicting the Lamentation. The rest of the presbytery, the entire nave, the wooden galleries, and the stalls were plunged in murky twilight. Perhaps this was intentional, Reynevan couldn't shake the thought, perhaps it was so that during prayers the demerits would not see each other's faces, so they would not try to guess from them the sins and transgressions of others. And compare them with their own.
"I am here."
The melodious and deep voice, which came from a recess hidden between the stalls, resounded—it was hard to resist such an impression—with gravity and dignity. But it was probably only an echo, the reverberation from the canopy of the vault, rattling among the stone walls. Reynevan approached.
Above the confessional, which exuded a faint scent of incense and varnish, loomed an image of Saint Anne with the Virgin and Child, with Mary on one knee and Jesus on the other. Reynevan saw the image, as it was illuminated by a small oil lamp. Illuminating the image, the lamp plunged the surroundings into an even deeper gloom, so Reynevan saw the man sitting inside the confessional only in outline.
"To you, then," said the man, awakening further echoes, "I will have to thank for the chance to regain freedom of movement, eh? Thank you, then. Though it seems to me that I owe rather more to a certain Wrocław canon, don't I? And to an event that took place… Well, say it for the record. So that I am completely sure I am talking to the right person. And that this is not a dream."
"July eighteenth, year eighteen."
"Where?"
"Wrocław. New Town…"
"Of course," the man confirmed after a moment. "Of course, Wrocław. Where else could it be, if not there? Good. Approach now. And assume the prescribed position."
"Excuse me?"
"Kneel."
"My brother was killed," Reynevan said, not moving from his place. "I myself am threatened with death. I am being hunted, I must flee. And before that, settle a few matters. And a few scores. Father Otto assured me that you could help me. Precisely you, whoever you are. But I have no intention of kneeling before you… What should I call you? Father? Brother?"
"Call me what you will. Even uncle. It is profoundly indifferent to me."
"I'm in no mood for jokes. I told you, my brother was killed. The prior said we can leave here. Let us leave then, let us depart this sad place, let us set out on our journey. And on the way, I will tell you what is necessary. So that you know what is necessary. And no more than necessary."
"I asked you," the echo of the man's voice rumbled even deeper, "to kneel."
"And I said: I have no intention of confessing to you."
"Whoever you are," said the man, "you have two paths to choose from. One here, to me, on your knees. The other through the monastery gate. Without me, it goes without saying. I am not a mercenary, boy, nor a hired thug to settle your affairs and scores. It is I, mark my words, who decide how much and what kind of knowledge I need. Besides, it is also a matter of mutual trust. You do not trust me, so how can I trust you?"
"The fact that you will leave prison," Reynevan snapped back defiantly, "you can owe to me. And to Father Otto. Mark that yourself and don't try to play the big shot. And present me with choices. Because it is not I, but you who stand before a choice. Either you go with me, or you rot here further. The choice…"
The man interrupted him by loudly knocking on the wood of the confessional.
"Know," he said after a moment, "that difficult choices are not new to me. You sin with pride, thinking I will fear them. Just this morning I did not know of your existence, just this evening, if need be, I will forget your existence. I repeat, and for the last time: either a confession, as an expression of trust, or farewell. Hurry with your choice, little time remains until Sext. And here, the liturgy of the hours is strictly observed."
Reynevan clenched his fists, fighting an overwhelming urge to turn and leave, to go out into the sun, fresh air, greenery, and space. Finally, he broke. Common sense prevailed.
"I don't even know," he forced out, kneeling on the worn wood, "if you are a priest."
"It doesn't matter," something like mockery sounded in the voice of the man from the confessional. "I am only interested in confession. Do not expect absolution."
"I don't even know what to call you."
"I have many names," came from behind the grille, quietly but distinctly. "The world knows me by various names. Since I have a chance to be restored to the world… I will have to choose something… Wilibald of Hirsau? Or perhaps, hmm… Benignus of Aix? Paul of Tyniec? Cornelius van Heemskerck? Or perhaps… Or perhaps… Master Szarlej? How does that strike you, boy: Master Szarlej? Well, alright, don't make faces. Simply: Szarlej. Will that do?"
"It will do. Let's get to the point, Szarlej."

***

Barely had the massive, truly fortress-worthy gates of the Strzegom Carmel slammed shut behind them with a bang, barely had they both moved away from the beggars and supplicants lounging by the gate, barely had they entered the shade of the roadside poplars, when Szarlej surprised Reynevan completely and utterly.
The recent demerit and prisoner, just a moment ago fascinatingly mysterious, brooding and dignifiedly silent, now suddenly roared with Homeric laughter, took a deer-like leap upwards, threw himself on his back into the weeds and for a few moments rolled among the greenery like a colt, all the while roaring and laughing alternately.
Finally, before the dumbfounded Reynevan's eyes, his recent confessor did a somersault, jumped up, and made a highly obscene gesture towards the gate with a bent elbow. The gesture was supported by a long litany of extremely indecent curses and insults. Several concerned the prior personally, several the Strzegom monastery, several the Carmelite order as a whole, and several were of a general nature.
"I didn't think," Reynevan calmed his horse, startled by the performance, "it was so hard there."
"Judge not, that ye be not judged," Szarlej brushed off his clothes. "That's for starters. Secondly, kindly refrain from comments, at least for a while. Thirdly, let us hasten to the town."
"To town? What for? I thought…"
"Don't think."
Reynevan shrugged, urged his mount along the highway. He pretended to turn his head, but couldn't stop himself from furtively observing the man walking beside his horse.
Szarlej was not very tall, he was even a little shorter than Reynevan, but this detail escaped attention, because the recent demerit was broad-shouldered, powerfully built, and probably strong, which could be inferred from his sinewy forearms, rippling with muscles, peeking out from under too-short sleeves. Szarlej had refused to leave the Carmel in a habit, and the clothes he was given were slightly odd.
The demerit's face had rather coarse features, not to say rugged; however, it was a lively face, constantly changing, playing a whole gamut of expressions. His hooked and masculinely prominent nose bore traces of an old break, the dimple of his chin disappeared into an old but still visible scar. Szarlej's eyes, green as bottle glass, were very strange. When one looked into them, one's hand instinctively checked if the purse was in place and the ring on the finger. Thoughts anxiously turned to the wife and daughters left at home, and faith in female virtue revealed all its naivety. Suddenly, one lost all hope of getting back borrowed money, five aces in a piquet hand ceased to be surprising, an authentic seal under a document began to look damn inauthentic, and a dearly bought horse began to wheeze strangely in the lungs. That's what one felt when looking into Szarlej's bottle-green eyes. At his face, in which there was decidedly more of Hermes than of Apollo.
They passed a large patch of suburban gardens, then the chapel and hospital of St. Nicholas. Reynevan knew that the hospice was run by the Joannites, he also knew that the order had a commandery in Strzegom. He immediately remembered Duke Kantner and his order, directing him to Mała Oleśnica. And he began to worry. He could be associated with the Joannites, so the road he was taking was not the road of a hunted wolf; he doubted that Canon Otto Beess would approve of the choice. At that moment, Szarlej for the first time gave proof of his perceptiveness. Or an equally rare ability to read minds.
"There is no reason for concern," he said freely and cheerfully. "Strzegom has over two thousand inhabitants, we will disappear among them like a fart in a snowstorm. Besides, you are under my protection. After all, I have committed myself."
"All this time," Reynevan replied after a long moment, which he needed to cool down, "I've been wondering how much such a commitment means to you."
Szarlej bared his white teeth at the flax gatherers marching in the opposite direction, comely lasses in loosely open shirts, revealing much of their sweaty and dusty charms. There were about a dozen lasses, and Szarlej grinned at each of them in turn, so Reynevan lost hope of hearing an answer.
"The question," the demerit surprised him, tearing his gaze from the round bottom of the last of the gatherers, jiggling under a sweat-soaked shift, "was of a philosophical nature. I don't usually answer such questions sober. But I promise you: I will give you an answer before sunset."
"I don't know if I'll live to see it. Or if I won't burn with curiosity before then."
Szarlej did not answer, but instead quickened his pace so that Reynevan had to force his horse into a light trot. So they quickly found themselves under the Świdnicka Gate. Beyond it, beyond a crowd of dirty pilgrims and ulcer-covered beggars squatting in the shade, was Strzegom, its narrow, muddy, stinking, and crowded streets.
Wherever and for whatever purpose their road led, Szarlej knew it, for he led confidently and without any hesitation. They passed through a street where so many looms clattered that it must have been Weavers' or Clothiers' Street. Soon they found themselves in a small square, dominated by a church tower. Cattle had recently been driven through the square—it could be seen and smelled.
"Just look," said Szarlej, stopping. "Church, tavern, brothel, and in the middle between them a pile of shit. Behold the parable of human life."
"And supposedly," Reynevan didn't even smile, "you don't philosophize sober."
"After a long period of abstinence," Szarlej unerringly directed his steps into an alley, towards a counter set with casks and tankards, "the mere scent of good beer intoxicates me. Hey, good man! Strzegom white, please! From the cellar! Be so kind as to pay, boy, for as Scripture says, argentum et aurum non est mihi."
Reynevan snorted, but threw a few hellers onto the counter.
"Will I finally find out what business brought you here?"
"You will. But only when I've drunk at least three of these businesses."
"And then?" Reynevan frowned. "That just-mentioned brothel?"
"I don't rule it out," Szarlej raised his tankard. "I don't rule it out, boy."
"And then? A three-day binge to celebrate regaining freedom?"
Szarlej did not answer, as he was drinking. Before he tilted the tankard, however, he winked from behind it, and that wink could mean anything.
"That was a mistake, though," Reynevan spoke seriously, staring at the demerit's throat, working with each swallow. "Perhaps the canon's mistake. Or perhaps mine, for listening to him. For getting involved with you."
Szarlej drank, paying him no attention.
"Fortunately," Reynevan continued, "all this can easily be remedied. And put an end to."
Szarlej took the tankard from his lips, sighed, licked the foam from his upper lip.
"You want to tell me something," he guessed. "Speak then."
"We two," Reynevan said coldly, "simply don't suit each other."
The demerit nodded for another beer to be poured for him, for a moment seeming interested only in the tankard.
"We differ a bit, true," he admitted, after taking a sip. "I, for example, am not accustomed to fornicating with other men's wives. If one looked carefully, a few more differences would probably be found. That's normal. For we were created in His image and likeness, but the Creator took care of individual traits. And praise be to Him for that."
Reynevan waved his hand, increasingly angry.
"I'm wondering," he blurted out, "whether to bid you farewell in the Creator's name. Right here, right now. So that we may go our separate ways. Because truly, I don't know how you can be of any use to me. I'm afraid, in no way at all."
Szarlej looked at him from over his tankard.
"Of use?" he repeated. "In what way? It's easy to find out. Shout: 'Help, Szarlej!', and help will be given to you."
Reynevan shrugged and turned with the intention of leaving. He bumped into someone. And that someone struck his horse so hard that the horse whinnied and reared, throwing him into the dung.
"How are you walking, you oaf? Where are you going with that nag? This is a town, not your goddamn village!"
The one who had bumped and berated him was one of three young men, richly, fashionably, and elegantly dressed. All three were remarkably similar—adorned in identical fanciful fezzes on hair curled with irons and padded doublets, quilted so densely that their sleeves looked like large caterpillars. They also wore the fashionable tight Parisian trousers called mi-parti, with legs in contrasting colours. All three carried turned staffs with knobs.
"Jesus Christ and all the saints," repeated the dandy, twirling his staff. "What boorishness in this Silesia, what obscene savagery! Will anyone ever teach them culture?"
"We will have to," said the second, with an identical Gallic accent, "take this trouble upon ourselves. And introduce them to Europe."
"Right," chimed in the third fop, in blue-and-red mi-parti. "To begin with, as part of the introduction, let's give this lout here a European-style tanning. Come on, gentlemen, to your sticks! And let no one be lazy!"
"Hold!" shouted the owner of the beer stall. "No brawls, merchant gentlemen! Or I'll call the guard!"
"Shut your trap, Silesian clod, or you'll get it too."
Reynevan tried to get up, but didn't manage in time. A staff thwacked him on the shoulder, another landed on his back with a dry crack, a third struck his buttocks. He decided there was no point waiting for further blows.
"Help!" he shrieked. "Szarlej! Help!"
Szarlej, who had been watching the incident with moderate interest, put down his tankard and, without hurrying, approached.
"Enough fun."
The dandies looked around—and as if on command, roared with laughter. Indeed, Reynevan had to admit, in his short and motley attire, the demerit did not look most dignified.
"Christ Almighty," snorted the first dandy, apparently pious. "What amusing figures one meets at this end of the world!"
"It's some local jester," judged the second. "You can tell by his outlandish clothes."
"Clothes do not make the man," Szarlej replied coldly. "Be gone from here, sirs. Quickly."
"Whaat?"
"Gentlemen," Szarlej repeated, "be so kind as to depart. Meaning, go away from here somewhere far. It doesn't have to be Paris. The opposite end of the city will suffice."
"Whaaaat?"
"Gentlemen," Szarlej repeated, slowly, patiently, and emphatically, as if to children. "Gentlemen, kindly remove yourselves from here. And occupy yourselves with something customary for you. Sodomy, for example. Otherwise, gentlemen, you will be beaten, and thoroughly. And before any of you gentlemen manages to say credo in Deum patrem omnipotentem."
The first fop swung his staff. Szarlej nimbly dodged the blow, grabbed the stick and twisted; the fop did a somersault and landed splat in the mud. With the staff that remained in his hand, the demerit whacked the second dandy over the head, sending him onto the brewer's counter, and with a blow as quick as thought, hit the third one on the arm. Meanwhile, the first one had jumped up and charged at Szarlej, roaring like a wounded bison. The demerit, with no visible effort, stopped the charge with a blow that bent the dandy in half. Szarlej then elbowed him powerfully in the kidneys, and as he fell, kicked him in the ear, seemingly nonchalantly. But the one kicked curled up like a worm and did not get up again.
The remaining two looked at each other and, as if on command, drew daggers. Szarlej wagged a finger at them.
"I wouldn't advise it," he said. "Knives cut!"
The fops did not heed the warning.
It seemed to Reynevan that he was observing the incident attentively. Yet he had missed something, for he did not understand how what happened had happened. Facing the dandies who were charging at him and flailing like windmills, Szarlej seemed almost motionless, and the movements he made when they reached him were slight, but so quick that they eluded the eye. One of the fops fell to his knees, his head bowed almost to the ground, gurgling and spitting out teeth one by one into the mud. The other sat and screamed. With his mouth wide open, he screamed and cried, thinly, modulatedly, incessantly, just like a long-unfed infant. He still held his own dagger in his hand, and his companion's knife was stuck in his thigh, embedded up to the gilded hilt.
Szarlej looked up at the sky, spread his hands in a gesture meaning "didn't I tell you." He took off his ridiculous, tight little jerkin. He approached the one spitting teeth. He skilfully grabbed him by the elbows, lifted him, seized him by the sleeves, and with a few precise kicks, kicked the dandy out of his padded doublet. Then he himself donned it.
"Clothes do not make the man," he said, stretching with relish, "but human dignity. But only a well-dressed man feels truly dignified."
Then he bent down and tore the embroidered alms-pouch from the fop's belt.
"A rich city, Strzegom," he said. "A rich city. Money, look for yourselves, is lying about in the streets."
"If I were you…" said the owner of the beer stall, his voice trembling slightly. "If I were you, I'd run, sir. These are rich merchants, guests of the noble Guncelin von Laasan. Serves them right, for the brawls they're always starting… But you'd better run, because Master von Laasan…"
"...rules the city," Szarlej finished, taking the purse from the third dandy. "Thanks for the beer, good man. Let's go, Reinmar."
They went. The dandy with the knife in his thigh bade them farewell for a long time with a desperate, unceasing, infantile wail:
"Waa-waa! Waa-waa! Waa-waa! Waa-waa!"
