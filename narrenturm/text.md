THE TOWER OF FOOLS
(Narrenturm)

***

The world did not perish and it did not burn.
At least, not all of it.
But it was still merry.
Especially for Reinmar of Bielawa, also known as Reynevan, an herbalist
and learned medic, related to many of the powerful figures of that world. This young man, having fallen in love with the beautiful and spirited wife of a Silesian
knight, experiences unforgettable moments of amorous passion.
Until, breaking down the door, the betrayed husband's kinsmen burst into the chamber.
And at that moment, things stop being merry for Reynevan.
Commenting on Reynevan's propensity for falling in love, Zawisza Czarny,
"the knight without flaw or stain," stated: "Oh, you won't die a natural death,
my boy!"
Zawisza, taken captive, was soon beheaded by the Turks.
And what of Reynevan?
Two more volumes of the trilogy lie before us.

***

The end of the world in the Year of Our Lord 1420 did not occur. Though much indicated
that it would.
The dark prophecies of the chiliasts, who foretold the coming of the End with considerable precision—namely, for the year 1420, the month of February, the Monday after Saint Scholastica's Day—did not come true. But well—Monday passed, Tuesday came, and after it Wednesday—and nothing. The Days of Punishment and Vengeance, preceding the advent of the Kingdom of God, did not arrive. Satan was not, though a thousand years had ended, released from his prison, nor did he go forth to deceive the nations from the four corners of the Earth. Not all the sinners of the world and enemies of God perished by the sword, fire, famine,
hail, by the fangs of beasts, by the stings of scorpions, and the venom of snakes. In vain did the faithful await
the coming of the Messiah on Mount Tabor, Baranek, Horeb, Zion, and Olivet; in vain
did the *quinque civitates*, the five chosen cities foretold
in Isaiah's prophecy—considered to be Pilsen, Klatovy, Louny, Slany, and Žatec—await the second coming of Christ. The end of the world did not occur. The world did not perish and it did not burn.
At least, not all of it.
But it was still merry.
Truly, this is an excellent pottage. Thick, spiced, and generously basted. I haven't eaten such in a long time. Thank you, worthy sirs, for the treat, and thank you too, little innkeeper-lass. Do I disdain beer, you ask? No. Rather not. If you permit, with pleasure. *Comedamus tandem, et bibamus, cras enim moriemur.*
There was no end of the world in 1420, nor a year later, nor two, nor three,
nor even four. Things ran, so to speak, their natural course.
Wars continued. Plagues multiplied, the *mors nigra* raged, hunger spread.
Neighbor killed and robbed neighbor, coveted his wife, and generally was a wolf to him.

From time to time, the Jews were treated to a little pogrom, and heretics to a little pyre. As for novelties
—skeletons danced in merry leaps
across cemeteries, Death with a scythe roamed the land, an incubus at night squeezed between the trembling thighs of sleeping
maidens,
a striga sat on the neck of a lone rider in a haunted place. The Devil visibly intervened in everyday affairs and circulated among people *tamquam leo rugiens*, like a roaring lion, seeking whom he might devour.
Many famous people died in those times. Ha, surely many were born too,
but it so happens that birth dates, by some strange chance, are not recorded in chronicles and for the life of them, no one remembers them, except
perhaps mothers and except
for those cases when a newborn had two heads or at least two pricks. But if a death, ha, then the date is certain, as if carved in stone.
Thus, in the year 1421, on the Monday after Laetare Sunday, having reached the meritorious age of sixty, Jan, styled Kropidło, a prince of
Piast blood and *episcopus Wloclaviensis*, died in Opole. Before his death, he had made a donation of six hundred *grzywna* to the city of Opole. They say that part of this sum, by the dying man's last will,
went to the famous Opole brothel "U Rudej Kundzi" (At the Red-Haired Floozy's). The bishop, a reveller,
frequented this establishment, located behind the Friars Minor monastery, until his very death—even if, towards the end of his life, only as an observer.
And in the summer—I don't recall the exact date—of the year 1422, King
Henry V of England, the victor of Agincourt, died in Vincennes. Surviving him by only two months,
the King of France, Charles VI, who had been completely mad for five years, died. The crown was claimed
by the madman's son, the Dauphin Charles. But the English did not recognize his rights. After all,
the Dauphin's own mother, Queen Isabeau, had long since declared him a bastard conceived
at some distance from the marital bed and with a man sound of mind.
And since bastards do not inherit the throne, the rightful ruler and monarch of France became an Englishman, Henry V's son, little Henry, only nine months old.
The regent in France became Henry's uncle, John Lancaster, Duke of Bedford. He,
together with the Burgundians, held northern France—including Paris—while the south
was held by the Dauphin Charles and the Armagnacs. And between their domains, dogs howled among the corpses on the battlefields.
And in the year 1423, on Whitsunday,
Peter de Luna, the Avignon Pope, an excommunicated schismatic, died in the castle of Peniscola near Valencia,
styling himself Benedict
XIII until his very death, contrary to the decrees of two councils.
Of others who died in those years and whom I remember, Ernest the Iron Habsburg, Duke of Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, Istria, and Trieste, died. Jan of Racibórz,
a prince of both Piast and Przemyslid blood, died. Wenceslaus,
*dux Lubinensis*, died young; Duke Henryk, co-ruler with his brother Jan of Ziębice, died.
Henryk, *dictus* Rumpoldus, Duke of Głogów and *Landvogt* of Upper Lusatia, died abroad. Mikołaj Trąba,
Archbishop of Gniezno, a worthy and wise man, died.
4

Michael Küchmeister, Grand Master of the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary, died in Malbork. Jakub Pęczak, called Ryba (Fish), a miller from near Bytom, also died. Ha,
one must admit, a tad less famous and known than those mentioned above, but
with this advantage over them, that I knew him personally and even drank with him. With those
previously mentioned—somehow, it never happened.
Important events also took place in culture at that time. The inspired
Bernardine of Siena preached, Jan Kanty and Jan Kapistran preached, Jan Gerson and Paweł Włodkowic taught, Christine de Pisan and Thomas Hemerken à Kempis wrote learnedly. Wawrzyniec of Brzezowa wrote his very beautiful chronicle. Andrei
Rublev painted icons, Tommaso Masaccio painted, Robert Campin painted. Jan van Eyck, painter to King John of Bavaria, created the "Adoration of the Mystic Lamb" for Saint Bavo's Cathedral in Ghent,
a rather beautiful polyptych, now adorning the chapel of Jodocus Vyd. In Florence, Master Pippo Brunelleschi completed the construction of the marvelous dome over the four naves of the church of Santa Maria del Fiore. And we in
Silesia are no worse—here, Mr. Piotr of Frankenstein finished
the construction of a very grand church dedicated to Saint James in the city of Nysa. It's quite
close by, from Milicz, not far, whoever hasn't been and seen it, has the opportunity to be and see.
In that same year, 1422, during Shrovetide itself, in the town of Lida, with great pomp, the old Lithuanian, Polish King Jogajła, celebrated his wedding—he married Sonka Holszańska,
a blooming and very young maiden, seventeen years of age, thus more than half
a century younger than himself. As they said, this maiden was more famous for her beauty than her morals.
Well, there was much trouble from that later. And Jogajła, as if he had quite forgotten
how to enjoy a young wife, already by early summer marched against the Prussian lords,
that is, the Teutonic Knights. Thus, the new—after Küchmeister—
Grand Master of the Order, Sir Paul von Rusdorf, had to become acquainted with Polish arms—and harshly acquainted—almost immediately after taking office.
What happened in Sonka's bedchamber, it's futile to investigate, but to thrash the Teuton's arse,
Jogajła was still spry enough.
Many important things also took place in the Bohemian Kingdom in those
times. Great was the commotion there, great bloodshed and ceaseless war.
About which I can hardly speak, by the way... Forgive an old man, noble sirs, but
fear is a human thing, and one has already had to take it on the chin for a careless word. On your
jackets, sirs, I see Polish Nałęcz and Habdank coats of arms, and on yours,
noble Czechs, the roosters of the lords of Dobrá Voda and the arrows of the knights of Strakonice...
And you, man of Mars, you are surely a Zettritz, I judge by the aurochs head in your crest.
And yours, sir knight, I cannot even place your diagonal checks and griffins.
Nor can it be excluded that you, friar of the Order of Saint Francis,
do not report to the Holy Office, and that you, brothers of Saint Dominic, do report,
that is rather certain. Thus you yourselves see that I can hardly gossip about Bohemian affairs in such an international and diverse company, not knowing
who here is for Albrecht, and who for the Polish king and prince. Who here is for Menhart
5

of Hradec and Oldrzych of Rožmberk, and who for Hynek Ptáček of Pirkštejn
and Jan Kolda of Žampach. Who here is a supporter of Comes Spytko of Melsztyn, and who
a partisan of Bishop Oleśnicki. I have no longing for a beating, and yet I know
I'll get one, for I've gotten one several times already. How so, you ask? Well, like this: if I say that
in the times I'm telling of, the brave Czech Hussites tailored such a jacket for the Germans,
smashing three successive papist crusades to dust and ashes, just watch how
I'll get it in the head from one side. And if I say that then, in the battles of Vítkov,
Vyšehrad, Žatec, and Německý Brod, the heretics defeated the crusaders
with diabolical aid, the others will take me and flog me. So I prefer to remain silent, and if
I say anything, then with the impartiality of a reporter—to relate the matter, as they say,
*sine ira et studio*, briefly, coolly, factually, and without adding any commentary of my own.

So I will say briefly: in the autumn of 1420, the Polish King Jogajła refused
to accept the Bohemian crown, which the Hussites had offered him. It was decided in Kraków that
this crown would be taken by the Lithuanian Duke Witold, who always wanted to be a king. However,
so as not to excessively irritate the Roman King Sigismund or the Pope,
Witold's nephew, Zygmunt, son of Korybut, was sent to Bohemia. Korybutowicz, at the head
of five thousand Polish knights, stood in Golden Prague in the year 1422, on Saint Stanislaus' Day. But already by Epiphany of the following year, the little prince
had to return to Lithuania—so vexed were the Luxembourger and Odo
Colonna, then Holy Father Martin V, about this Bohemian succession. And what do you say? Already in 1424, on the eve of the Visitation of Mary, Korybutowicz was back in Prague. This time,
against Jogajła and Witold, against the Pope, against the Roman King. That is, as an outlaw and exile. At the head of similar outlaws and exiles.
And no longer in the thousands, as before, but only numbering in the hundreds.

In Prague, meanwhile, the revolution, like Saturn, devoured its own children, and faction struggled with faction. Jan of Želiv, beheaded on the Monday after Reminiscere Sunday in 1422, was already mourned in all churches
as a martyr by May of that same year. Golden Prague also stood up defiantly to Tábor, but here the scythe hit a stone.
Meaning, Jan Žižka, the great warrior. In the Year of Our Lord 1424,
on the second day after the Nones of June, at Malešov, on the Bohyňka river,
Žižka taught the Praguers a terrible lesson. Many, oh, many were the widows and orphans in Prague after that battle.
Who knows, perhaps it was the orphans' tears that caused Jan Žižka
of Trocnov, and later of Kalich, to die shortly thereafter, on the Wednesday before St. Gall's Day, in Přibyslav near the Moravian border. And he was buried in Hradec Králové, and there he lies.
And just as before some wept because of him, now others wept for him. Because he
had orphaned them. That is why they called themselves the Orphans...
But surely you all remember this. For these are quite recent times. And yet they seem...
historical.

6

And do you know, worthy sirs, how to tell that a time is historical? By the fact
that a lot happens, and quickly.
And then, a great deal happened, and very quickly.
The end of the world, as has been said, did not come. Though much indicated that it would. For there came—just as the prophecies willed—great wars and great disasters
for the Christian people, and many men perished. It seemed God Himself willed
that the advent of a new order be preceded by the destruction of the old. It seemed that the Apocalypse was approaching. That the Ten-Horned Beast was emerging from the Abyss. That the Four Horsemen,
terrible, were to be seen at any moment amidst the smoke of fires and bloodstained fields.
That soon, very soon, the trumpets would sound and the seals would be broken. That fire would fall from the heavens. That the Star Wormwood would fall on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. That a maddened man,
when he spied the footprint of another in the ashes, would kiss that footprint
with tears.
It was terrifying at times, so much so that, begging your pardon, noble sirs, one's arse clenched.
It was a dreadful time. Evil. And if it is your will, sirs, I shall tell of it. Just to kill boredom,
before the foul weather that keeps us here in the inn subsides.
I will tell, if you wish, of that time. Of the people who lived then, and of those
who lived then, but were by no means human. I will tell of how
both groups struggled with what that time brought them. With fate. And with themselves.
This story begins sweetly and pleasantly, mistily and tenderly—with delightful, sentimental
love. But let that not deceive you, my dear sirs.
Let that not deceive you.

***

Chapter 1
in which the reader has the opportunity to meet Reinmar of Bielawa, called Reynevan, and that from several of his best sides at once, including a fluent
knowledge of *ars amandi*, the arcana of horsemanship, and the Old Testament, not necessarily in that order. The chapter also speaks of Burgundy—treated
as narrowly as it is broadly.

Through the open window of the small room, against the sky still dark after a recent storm,
three towers were visible—the town hall tower, closest, then the slender tower of Saint John the Evangelist's church, gleaming
in the sun with brand-new red tiles, and behind it, the round
keep of the ducal castle. Swallows darted around the church tower,
startled by the recent ringing of bells. The bells had not rung for quite
a few moments, but the ozone-saturated air still
seemed to vibrate with their sound.
Bells had also rung quite recently from the towers of the churches of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Corpus Christi. These towers, however, were not visible from the little window of the attic room
of the wooden building, stuck like a swallow's nest to the hospice
and Augustinian monastery complex.
It was the hour of Sext. The monks began *Deus in adiutorium*. And Reinmar of Bielawa,
called Reynevan by his friends, kissed the sweaty collarbone of Adela von
Stercza, freed himself from her embrace, and lay beside her, panting,
on the bedclothes hot from love.
From beyond the wall, from Klasztorna Street, came shouts, the rumble of carts, the dull thud of empty barrels, the melodious clinking of pewter and copper vessels. It was
Wednesday, market day, as usual drawing
a multitude of merchants and buyers to Oleśnica.
*Memento, salutis Auctor*
*quod nostri quondam corporis,*
*ex illibata virgine*
8

*nascendo, formam sumpseris.*
*Maria mater gratiae,*
*mater misericordiae,*
*tu nos ab hoste protege,*
*et hora mortis suscipe...*¹
They're already singing the hymn, thought Reynevan, embracing
Adela with a languid movement, she who hailed from distant Burgundy, the wife of Knight Gelfrad von Stercza. Already
the hymn. Unbelievable, how quickly moments of happiness pass. One would wish them
to last forever, and yet they pass like a fleeting dream...
"Reynevan... *Mon amour*... My divine boy..." Adela predatorily
and greedily interrupted his sleepy reverie. She too was aware of the passage of time, but
apparently had no intention of wasting it on philosophical reflections.
Adela was completely, utterly, entirely naked.
Different countries, different customs, thought Reynevan, how very interesting it is to get to know the world and its people. Silesian and German women, for example, when it comes down to it, never
allow their shifts to be pulled up higher than their navels. Polish and Czech women pull
them up themselves, and willingly, above their breasts, but for nothing in the world will they remove them completely. And Burgundian women, oh, they instantly shed everything, their hot blood during amorous
passions evidently cannot bear even a scrap of cloth on their skin. Ah, what joy to get to know
the world. Burgundy must be a beautiful land. Its landscape must be beautiful.
Soaring mountains... Steep hills... Valleys...
"Ah, aaah, *mon amour*," moaned Adela von Stercza, pressing herself
to Reynevan's hand with her entire Burgundian landscape.
Reynevan, incidentally, was twenty-three years old and had seen rather little of the world. He knew very few Czech women, even fewer Silesian and German women, one
Polish woman, one Gypsy woman—and as for other nationalities, he had only once been rejected by a Hungarian woman. His erotic experiences could therefore by no means be counted among the impressive;
nay, they were, frankly speaking, quite meager, both in quantity and quality. But they had still filled him with pride and conceit.
Reynevan—like every testosterone-fueled youth—considered himself a great
seducer and expert in love, before whom the female sex held no secrets. The truth, however, was that his eleven previous trysts with Adela
von Stercza had taught Reynevan more about *ars amandi* than his entire three years of study
in Prague. Reynevan, however, had not realized that Adela was teaching him—he was certain
that his innate talent was at play here.
*Ad te levavi oculos meos*
*qui habitas in caelis*
*Ecce sicut oculi servorum*
*ad manum dominorum suorum.*
9

*Sicut oculi ancillae in manibus dominae suae*
*ita oculi nostri ad Dominum Deum nostrum,*
*Donec misereatur nostri*
*Miserere nostri Domine...*²
Adela seized Reynevan by the nape of his neck and pulled him onto herself. Reynevan, grasping what was appropriate, loved her. He loved her strongly and with abandon and—as if that
were not enough—whispered assurances of love into her ear. He was happy. Very
happy.

***

The happiness Reynevan was currently indulging in, he owed—indirectly, of
course—to the Lord's saints. For it was like this:
Feeling remorse for some sins, known only to him and his confessor,
the Silesian knight Gelfrad von Stercza set out on a penitential pilgrimage to the tomb of Saint
James. But on the way, he changed his plans. He decided that Compostela was definitely
too far, and since Saint Giles hadn't exactly fallen from a magpie's tail either, a pilgrimage to Saint-Gilles would suffice entirely. But Gelfrad
was not destined to reach Saint-Gilles either. He only made it to Dijon, where by chance he met
a sixteen-year-old Burgundian girl, the beautiful Adela de Beauvoisin. Adela, who utterly charmed Gelfrad,
was an orphan, had two rakish and irresponsible brothers,
who without batting an eye married their sister off to the Silesian
knight. Although in the brothers' opinion Silesia lay somewhere between the Tigris and the Euphrates, Stercza was
an ideal brother-in-law in their eyes, as he did not haggle too much over the dowry.
Thus, the Burgundian woman ended up in Heinrichsdorf, a village near Ziębice, which Gelfrad held as a fief. And in Ziębice, now as Adela von Stercza,
she caught the eye of Reynevan of Bielawa. Mutually.
"Aaaach!" cried Adela von Stercza, wrapping her legs around Reynevan's
back. "Aaaaa-aaach!"
This "aahing" would never have happened, it would all have ended with
exchanged glances and furtive gestures, if not for a third saint,
George, namely. For on Saint George's Day, Gelfrad von Stercza, like the rest of the crusaders, cursed
and swore, joining
in September of the year 1422 one of the umpteenth
anti-Hussite crusades, organized by the Elector of Brandenburg
and the Margraves of Meissen. The crusaders did not record great successes on their account then—they entered Bohemia and very quickly left it, not risking
combat with the Hussites at all. But although there were no battles, there were casualties—one of them turned
out to be Gelfrad himself, who broke his leg extremely badly in a fall from his horse
10

and currently, as indicated by letters sent to his family, was still recuperating somewhere
in Pleissenland. Adela, meanwhile, a grass widow, living at that time
with her husband's family in Bierutów, could meet Reynevan without hindrance
in the little room in the Oleśnica Augustinian monastery complex, near the hospital
where Reynevan had his workshop.

***

The monks in the Church of Corpus Christi began to sing the second of the three psalms
scheduled for Sext. We must hurry, thought Reynevan. By the *capitulum*,
or at the latest by the *Kyrie*, not a moment after, Adela must disappear
from the hospice grounds. No one should see her here.
*Benedictus Dominus*
*qui non dedit nos*
*in captionem dentibus eorum.*
*Anima nostra sicut passer erepta est*
*de laqueo venantium...*
Reynevan kissed Adela on the hip, then, inspired by the monks' singing,
drew a deep breath into his lungs and delved into the flowers of henna and nard, into saffron,
into fragrant calamus and cinnamon, into myrrh and aloes, and into all resinous trees. Adela, stretched out, straightened her arms and dug her fingers into his hair, with gentle movements
of her hips supporting his biblical initiatives.
"Oh, ooooooh... *Mon amour*... *Mon magicien*... Divine boy... Magician..."
*Qui confidunt in Domino, sicut mons Sion*
*non commovebitur in aeternum,*
*qui habitat in Hierusalem...*
Already the third psalm, thought Reynevan. How fleeting are the moments of happiness...
"*Revertere*," he purred, kneeling. "Turn, turn, O Shulamite."
Adela turned, knelt, and leaned forward, gripping
the linden wood headboard firmly and presenting
Reynevan with all the dazzling beauty of her reverse. Aphrodite Kallipygos, he thought, approaching her. The classical association and erotic
sight made him approach like the aforementioned Saint George, charging
with levelled spear at the dragon of Silene. Kneeling behind Adela like King Solomon
behind the throne of Lebanese wood, he grasped her with both hands by the vineyards of Engedi.
11

"To a mare in Pharaoh's chariot," he whispered, bent over her neck,
shapely as the tower of David, "I compare you, my love."
And he compared. Adela cried out through clenched teeth. Reynevan slowly slid
his hands along her sweat-slicked sides, climbed
the palm tree and seized its fruit-laden branches.
The Burgundian threw back her head like a mare before a jump
over an obstacle.
*Quia non relinquet Dominus virgam peccatorum,*
*super sortem iustorum*
*ut non extendant iusti*
*ad iniquitatem manus suas...*
Adela's breasts bounced under Reynevan's hand like two fawns,
twin gazelles.
He placed his other hand under her pomegranate grove.
"*Duo... ubera tua*," he moaned, "*sicut duo... hinuli capreae gemelli... qui*
*pascuntur... in liliis... Umbilicus tuus crater... tornatilis numquam... indigens*
*poculis... Venter tuus... sicut acervus... tritici vallatus liliis...*"
"Ach... aaaach... aaach..." counterpointed the Burgundian woman, who did not know Latin.
*Gloria Patri, et Filio et Spiritui sancto.*
*Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper*
*et in saecula saeculorum, Amen.*
*Alleluia!*
The monks sang. And Reynevan, kissing Adela von Stercza's neck, with abandon,
frenzied, running through the mountains, leaping over the hills, *saliens in montibus, transiliens colles*, was for his lover like a young stag on the mountains of spices. *Super
montes aromatum.*

***

The struck door flew open with a bang and such force that the bolt, torn
from the doorframe, flew out the window like a meteor. Adela shrieked thinly and terrifyingly. And into the small room burst the von Stercza brothers. It was immediately apparent
that this was not a friendly visit.
Reynevan rolled off the bed, shielded by it from the intruders, grabbed his clothes and began
to put them on hastily. He succeeded to a large extent, but only
because the Stercza brothers directed their frontal attack towards their sister-in-law.
12

"You whore!" roared Morold von Stercza, dragging naked Adela from the bedclothes. "You disgusting whore!"
"You loose slut!" chimed in Wittich, his older brother. While Wolfher, the eldest after Gelfrad, didn't even open his mouth, pale rage had
robbed him of speech. He struck Adela across the face with a swing. The Burgundian shrieked. Wolfher
followed up, this time with a backhand.
"Don't you dare hit her, Stercza!" shouted Reynevan, his voice breaking
and trembling with panic and a paralyzing
feeling of helplessness, caused by his half-pulled-up
trousers. "Don't you dare, do you hear?"
The shout had an effect, though not entirely the intended one. Wolfher and Wittich, forgetting
for a moment about their unfaithful sister-in-law, leaped at Reynevan. A hail of blows and kicks rained down on the boy. He cowered under the blows, instead of defending himself or
shielding himself, stubbornly pulling up his trousers—as if they weren't trousers at all, but
some magical armor capable of protecting and shielding him from wounds, some enchanted
cuirass of Astolfo or Amadis of Gaul. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Wittich draw a knife.
Adela shrieked.
"Leave him," Wolfher snarled at his brother. "Not here!"
Reynevan managed to rise to his knees. Wittich, enraged, his face white with fury,
dashed forward and punched him, sending him to the floor again. Adela
cried out shrilly, the cry cut short as Morold struck her in the face and pulled her
by the hair.
"Don't you dare..." Reynevan moaned, "...hit her, scoundrels!"
"You son of a bitch!" Wittich screamed. "Just you wait!"
He jumped forward, struck, kicked once, twice. On the third, Wolfher stopped
him.
"Not here," he repeated calmly, and it was an ominous calm. "To the courtyard
with him. We're taking him to Bierutów. This whore too."
"I am innocent!" wailed Adela von Stercza. "He bewitched me!
Enchanted me! He's a sorcerer! *Le sorcier! Le diab...*"
Morold cut off the word, stifled it with a blow.
"Silence, you strumpet," he snarled. "We'll give you a chance to scream yet.
Just wait a little."
"Don't you dare hit her!" screamed Reynevan.
"You too," Wolfher added with his menacing calm, "we'll give you a chance to scream, little cockerel. Come on, out with him."
The way from the attic led down rather steep stairs. The von Stercza brothers threw
Reynevan down them; the boy fell onto the landing, smashing
part of the wooden balustrade with his body. Before he could rise, they grabbed him again and threw him straight onto
the courtyard, onto sand decorated with steaming
piles of horse manure.

13

"Well, well, well," said Niklas Stercza, the youngest of the brothers, merely a youth, holding the horses. "Who's this that fell to us? Could it be Reinmar
Bielau?"
"The well-read smart-arse Bielau," snorted Jencz von Knobelsdorf, known as Puchacz (Eagle-Owl), a kinsman and crony of the Sterczas, standing over Reynevan as he scrambled
from the sand. "The loud-mouthed smart-arse
Bielau!"
"A damned poet," added Dieter Haxt, another friend of the family. "A regular Abelard!"
"And to prove to him that we too are well-read," said Wolfher, descending the stairs, "we'll do to him the same thing that was done to Abelard, when caught with Heloise.
Exactly the same. Well, Bielawa? How does being a capon appeal to you?"
"Fuck yourself, Stercza."
"What? What?" Though it seemed impossible, Wolfher Stercza turned
even paler. "The little cockerel still dares to open his beak? Dares
to crow? Give me the bullwhip, Jencz!"
"Don't you dare hit him!" Adela, now dressed, though incompletely, being brought down the
stairs, screamed completely unexpectedly. "Don't you dare! Or I'll tell everyone
what you're like! That you yourself made advances to me, pawed me, and tried to seduce me
into debauchery! Behind your brother's back! That you promised me revenge when I drove you away!
That's why you're like this now... Like this..."
She lacked the German word, which ruined the whole tirade. Wolfher
only laughed.
"Indeed!" he scoffed. "Who's going to listen to a Frenchwoman, a common whore.
The bullwhip, Puchacz!"
The courtyard suddenly darkened with Augustinian habits.
"What's happening here?" cried the venerable prior Erazm Steinkeller, a thin
and very sallow old man. "What are you doing, Christians?"
"Get lost!" roared Wolfher, cracking the bullwhip. "Away, shaven pates,
away, to your breviaries, to your prayers! Don't meddle in knightly affairs, or
you'll be sorry, blackrobes!"
"Lord," the prior folded his liver-spotted hands, "forgive them,
for they know not what they do. *In nomine Patris, et Filii...*"
"Morold, Wittich!" screamed Wolfher. "Bring the strumpet here! Jencz, Dieter, fetter the gosling!"
"And perhaps," sneered Stefan Rotkirch, another friend of the house, who had been silent until then, "we could drag him a bit behind a horse?"
"Could be. But first, I'll flog him!"
He aimed the whip at the still-lying Reynevan, but did not strike, his hand caught by Brother Innocent. Brother Innocent was of considerable height and build, which was evident even despite his humble monastic stoop. His grip
immobilized Wolfher's hand like an iron club.
14

Stercza cursed obscenely, wrenched himself free, and forcefully pushed the monk. But he might as well have pushed the keep of Oleśnica castle. Brother Innocent, nicknamed "Brother Insolent" by his confreres, did not even flinch. He, however,
retaliated with a shove that sent Wolfher halfway across the courtyard and knocked him onto a dung heap.
For a moment, there was silence. And then everyone rushed at the large monk. Puchacz, the first to reach him, got a fist in the teeth and rolled in the sand.
Morold Stercza, hit in the ear, staggered sideways with a dazed look. The rest
swarmed the Augustinian like ants. The large figure in the black habit completely disappeared under the blows and kicks. Brother Insolent, though soundly beaten, retaliated just as soundly and completely unchristianly, entirely, but entirely against
the humble rule of Saint Augustine.
At this sight, the old prior became agitated. He turned red as a cherry,
roared like a lion, and threw himself into the battle's thickest fray, striking
right and left with fierce blows from his rosewood crucifix.
"*Pax!*" he screamed, striking. "*Pax! Vobiscum!* Love thy neighbor! Thine own! *Proximum tuum! Sicut te ipsum!* Sons of bitches!"
Dieter Haxt punched him. The old man's legs went out from under him, his sandals flew upwards, describing picturesque trajectories in the air. The Augustinians
raised a cry, and several of them couldn't restrain themselves and rushed into the fray. The courtyard seethed
in earnest.
Pushed out of the melee, Wolfher Stercza drew his short sword and brandished it—blood threatened
to flow. But Reynevan, who had already managed to get up, struck him on the back of the head
with the handle of a bullwhip he had picked up from the ground. Stercza clutched his head and turned,
at which point Reynevan lashed him across the face with the whip; Wolfher fell.
Reynevan lunged for the horses.
"Adela! Here! To me!"
Adela didn't even flinch, and the indifference on her face was astonishing.
Reynevan jumped into the saddle. The horse neighed and danced.
"Adeeelaaa!"
Morold, Wittich, Haxt, and Puchacz were already running towards him. Reynevan turned his horse,
whistled piercingly, and galloped off, straight for the gate.
"After him!" roared Wolfher Stercza. "Mount up and after him!"
Reynevan's first thought was to flee towards the Mariacka Gate and then,
out of the city, into the Spalickie Woods. Krowia Street, however, turned out to be
completely choked with carts in the direction of the gate, and the horse, urged on and frightened by shouts,
showed a great deal of its own initiative, as a result of which, before he had properly
grasped the situation, Reynevan was already galloping towards the market square, splashing
mud and scattering pedestrians. He didn't need to look back
to know that the pursuit was on his heels. He heard the thundering of hooves, the neighing of horses, the wild roars of the Sterczas, and the furious
shouts of the people being knocked over.
15

He struck the horse with his heel in the flank, in full gallop he snagged and knocked over a baker carrying
a basket; loaves, rolls, and croissants flew like hail into the mud, into which the hooves of the Sterczas' horses
would soon trample them. Reynevan didn't even look back, more interested in what was
ahead of him than what was behind him, and ahead of him, a cart piled high
with brushwood was growing in his vision. The cart blocked almost the entire alley, and in the place
it didn't block, a group of half-naked children was squatting, busy digging
something extremely interesting out of the manure.
"We've got you, Bielau!" roared Wolfher Stercza from behind, also seeing
what was on the road.
The horse was tearing along so fast that there was no question of stopping it. Reynevan pressed himself to
the mane and closed his eyes. Thanks to this, he didn't see how the half-naked children
scattered with the speed and grace of rats. He didn't look back, so he also didn't see
how the peasant in a sheepskin coat, pulling the cart with brushwood, turned around, somewhat stupefied,
turning the shaft and the cart at the same time. Nor did he see how the Sterczas
crashed into the turned cart. Nor how Jencz Knobelsdorf flew
from his saddle and swept away half of the brushwood on the cart with his body.
Reynevan galloped through Świętojańska Street, between the town hall and the mayor's house,
and at full speed burst into the enormous Oleśnica market square. The problem was that
the market square, though huge, was teeming with people. And pandemonium broke out. Heading
for the southern frontage and the stout quadrilateral of the tower above
the Oławska Gate visible above it, Reynevan galloped among people, horses, oxen, pigs, carts,
and stalls, leaving a battlefield behind him. People screamed, wailed, and cursed,
cattle bellowed, pigs squealed, stalls and benches overturned, from which
a hail of various objects flew around: pots, bowls, tubs, hoes,
pokers, fishing weirs, sheepskins, felt caps, linden spoons, tallow candles, bast shoes, and clay cockerels with whistles. Food products also rained down around
—eggs, cheeses, baked goods, peas, groats, carrots, turnips, onions,
even live crayfish. All sorts of poultry flew in clouds of feathers and shrieked in various voices. The Sterczas, still
on Reynevan's heels, completed the work
of destruction.
Startled by a goose flying right past his nose, Reynevan's horse shied
and crashed into a fish stall, smashing crates and overturning
barrels. The enraged fisherman swung his fish basket with force, missing
Reynevan, but hitting
the horse's rump. The horse neighed and bolted sideways, overturning
a portable stall with threads and ribbons; for a few seconds, it danced in place, splashing
in a silvery and stinking
mass of roach, bream, and carp, mixed with a riot of colorful
spools. Reynevan only avoided falling by a miracle. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the thread seller
running towards him with a large axe, God only knows what purpose it served
in the thread trade. He spat out goose feathers stuck to his lips, controlled the horse, and galloped into Rzeźnicza (Butcher's) Street, from where, as he knew, the Oławska Gate
was very close.
16

"I'll rip your balls off, Bielawa!" roared Wolfher Stercza from behind. "I'll rip them off and
shove them down your throat!"
"Kiss my arse!"
There were only four pursuers left—Rotkirch had been pulled from his horse and was
currently being roughed up by enraged market vendors.
Reynevan sped like an arrow through an alley of hanging
carcasses. Butchers leaped out of the way in panic, but he still knocked over one carrying
a large leg of beef on his shoulder. The fallen man tumbled
with the leg under the hooves of Wittich's horse; the horse
shied and reared, Wolfher's horse crashed into it from behind. Wittich flew
from the saddle straight onto a butcher's counter, nose-first into livers,
lights, and kidneys; Wolfher fell on top of him. His foot got stuck in the stirrup; before he freed himself,
he had demolished a considerable part of the shambles and was covered head to toe in mud and gore.
Reynevan quickly and at the last moment ducked onto the horse's neck, thus
fitting under a wooden sign with a painted pig's head. Dieter Haxt, following
close on his heels, didn't manage to duck. The board with the likeness
of a joyfully smiling pig struck him on the forehead with a resounding thwack. Dieter flew
from the saddle, landed on a pile of refuse, startling cats. Reynevan looked back. Only Niklas was chasing
him now.
At a full gallop, he burst out of the butchers' alley onto a small square where
tanners were working. And when a frame hung with wet hides suddenly loomed
before his nose, he reared his horse and forced it to jump. The horse jumped. And Reynevan didn't
fall. Again, by a miracle.
Niklas wasn't so lucky. His horse dug in its heels before the frame and rammed
it, sliding in the mud, scraps of meat, and greasy offal. The youngest Stercza
somersaulted over the horse's head. Very, very unfortunately. His groin and belly
straight onto a fleshing knife left by the tanners.
Initially, Niklas didn't comprehend at all what had happened. He scrambled to his feet,
reached his horse, and only when the steed snorted and backed away, did his knees
buckle and break beneath him. Still not quite knowing what was happening, the youngest Stercza slid through the mud after his retreating and panickedly snorting
horse. Finally, he let go of the
reins and tried to stand. He realized something was wrong, looked at his
belly. And screamed.
He knelt amidst a rapidly growing pool of blood.
Dieter Haxt rode up, reined in his horse, and dismounted. Wolfher and Wittich Stercza did the same
a moment later.
Niklas sat down heavily. He looked again at his belly. He screamed,
and then burst into tears. His eyes began to cloud over—the blood gushing
from him mixed with the blood of oxen and pigs slaughtered there that morning.
"Niklaaaas!"
Niklas Stercza coughed, choked. And died.

17

"You're already dead, Reynevan Bielau!" roared Wolfher Stercza, pale
with rage, towards the gate. "I'll catch you, kill you, destroy you, exterminate you along
with your entire viperous kin! Along with your entire viperous kin, do you hear?"
Reynevan didn't hear. Amidst the clatter of hooves on the bridge planks, he was just riding
out of Oleśnica and heading south, straight onto the Wrocław road.

***

Chapter 2
in which the reader learns even more about Reynevan, from conversations
various people have about him, both well-wishers and those quite the opposite.
Meanwhile, Reynevan himself wanders through the forests near Oleśnica. The author
is sparing with descriptions of this wandering, so the reader, *nolens volens*, must
imagine it for themselves.

"Sit down, sit down at the table, gentlemen," invited Bartłomiej Sachs,
the mayor of Oleśnica. "What shall I have served? Of wines, frankly speaking, I have nothing
with which I could impress. But beer, oho, it was delivered to me straight from Świdnica today,
prime brew, first wort, from a deep, cold cellar."
"Beer then, beer, Master Bartłomiej," Jan Hofrichter, one
of the city's wealthier merchants, rubbed his hands. "Beer is our drink, let the gentry
and various dandies sour their innards with wine... With your reverence's pardon..."
"It's nothing," smiled Father Jakub von Gall, pastor of Saint
John the Evangelist. "I am no longer a nobleman, I am a plebeian. And a plebeian, as the name itself
suggests, is always with the people, so it ill befits me to disdain beer either. And I can
drink, for vespers have been said."
They sat at the table, in the large, low-ceilinged, starkly whitewashed town hall room, the usual
place for magistrate meetings. The mayor in his usual chair, back to the fireplace, Father
Gall beside him, facing the window. Hofrichter sat opposite, next to him
Łukasz Frydman, a renowned and wealthy goldsmith, in his fashionably padded doublet
and velvet roundlet on his coiffed head, looking
every bit a nobleman.
The mayor cleared his throat, not waiting for the servants with the beer, and began.
"And what have we here?" he spoke, clasping his hands over his prominent belly. "What
have the noble, belted knights deigned to treat us to in our town? A brawl at the Augustinians. Horse,
that is, races through the city streets. Tumult in the market square, several injured, including one child seriously. Damaged
property, ruined goods. Significant, that is, material losses; *mercatores et institores*
were practically pushing their way in here with demands for compensation.
Truly, I should be sending them with their claims to the Stercza lords, to Bierutów, Ledna, and Sterzendorf."
"Better not," Jan Hofrichter advised dryly. "Though I too am of the opinion that the noble knights have lately become excessively unruly, one must not forget either
the causes of the matter, or its consequences. The consequence, a tragic consequence,
is the death of young Niklas de Stercza. And the cause: lechery and debauchery.
The Sterczas were defending their brother's honor, chasing the gosling who seduced their sister-in-law, defiled
the marital bed. True, in their zeal, they overdid it a bit..."
The merchant fell silent under the significant gaze of Father Jakub. For when Father
Jakub signaled with a look his desire to speak, even the mayor himself fell silent.
Jakub Gall was not only the pastor of the town parish, but also the secretary of Duke Konrad of Oleśnica and a canon in the Wrocław cathedral chapter.
"Adultery is a sin," spoke the priest, straightening his thin
figure at the table. "Adultery is also a crime. But God punishes sins,
and the law punishes crimes. Lynchings and murders are justified by nothing."
"That's it, that's it," the mayor interjected, but immediately fell silent and devoted himself to the beer,
which had just been served.
"Niklas Stercza, which pains us greatly," added Father Gall, "died tragically,
but as a result of an unfortunate accident. But if Wolfher and his company had caught
Reinmar de Bielau, we would be dealing with murder in our jurisdiction.
It is not known, moreover, whether we will not. I remind you that Prior Steinkeller,
a saintly old man severely beaten by the Sterczas, lies unconscious at the Augustinians. If he dies from this beating, there will be a problem. For the Sterczas, precisely."
"As for the crime of adultery," goldsmith Łukasz Frydman
examined the rings on his well-groomed fingers, "consider,
honorable sirs, that it is not our jurisdiction at all. Although
debauchery took place in Oleśnica, the delinquents are not subject to us. Gelfrad Stercza, the betrayed
husband, is a vassal of the Duke of Ziębice. Similarly, the seducer, young medic Reinmar de Bielau..."
"The debauchery happened here, and the crime was here," Hofrichter said firmly. "And not a trivial one, if one is to believe what Stercza's wife confessed at the Augustinians. That the medicus bewitched her with charms and led her to sin through sorcery.
Forced her against her will."
"They all say that," boomed the mayor from within his tankard.
"Especially," the goldsmith added without emotion, "when someone like Wolfher de Stercza holds a knife to their throat. Reverend Father Jakub said it well, that
adultery is a crime, *crimen*, and as such requires investigation and trial. We
do not want family feuds or street battles here, we will not allow unruly
nobles to raise a hand against clergy here, brandish knives, and trample people in
the squares. In Świdnica, for striking an armorer and threatening him with a sword, one of the Pannewitzes
went to the tower.
20

And so it should be. The times of knightly lawlessness cannot return.
The matter must go before the Duke."
"All the more so," confirmed the mayor with a nod, "because Reinmar
of Bielawa is a nobleman, and Adela Sterczowa is a noblewoman. We cannot
flog him or banish her from the city like any common strumpet. The matter must go before
the Duke."
"There is no need to rush this," assessed Pastor Jakub
Gall, looking at the ceiling. "Duke Konrad is leaving for Wrocław, and before his departure, he has countless matters
on his mind. Rumors, as rumors do, have probably already reached him, but it is not the time to
make these rumors official. It will be enough to present the matter to the Duke when he returns. By then,
much may resolve itself."
"I also think so," Bartłomiej Sachs nodded again.
"And I," added the goldsmith.
Jan Hofrichter adjusted his marten fur cap, blew the foam from his tankard.
"There's no need to inform the Duke for now," he declared, "we'll wait until he returns,
in this I agree with you, honorable sirs. But we must notify the Holy Office.
And quickly. About what we found in the medicus's workshop. Don't shake
your head, Master Bartłomiej, don't make faces, worthy Master Łukasz. And you, reverend sir, don't
sigh and count flies on the ceiling. I am as eager for this as you are, I
desire the Inquisition here as much as you do. But many people were present at the opening of the workshop.
And where there are many people, there will always be, I don't think I'm being very original, at
least one who informs the Inquisition. And when the visitor appears in Oleśnica,
he will ask us first why we delayed."
"And I," Pastor Gall tore his gaze from the ceiling, "will explain the delay. I,
personally. For it is my parish and on me rests the duty
of informing the bishop and the papal inquisitor. It is also up to me to assess whether circumstances have arisen
that justify summoning and troubling the curia and the Office."
"The witchcraft Adela Sterczowa screamed about at the Augustinians,
is that not a circumstance? The workshop is not? The alchemical alembic and the pentagram on
the floor are not? Mandrake? Skulls, dead hands? Crystals and mirrors? Bottles and flasks with God knows what filth or poison? Frogs and lizards in jars? Are these not circumstances?"
"They are not. The inquisitors are serious men. Their business is the *inquisitio de articulis fidei*. Not old wives' tales, superstitions, and frogs; I have no intention of bothering them
with such things."
"And the books? Those lying here?"
"The books," Jakub Gall replied calmly, "must first be studied.
Thoroughly and without haste. The Holy Office does not forbid reading. Nor the possession
of books."
"In Wrocław," Hofrichter said grimly, "two just went to
the stake. Word has it, precisely for the books they possessed."
21

"Not for books at all," the pastor contradicted dryly, "but for contumacy,
for a defiant refusal to renounce the content proclaimed, contained in those books.
Among which were writings of Wycliffe and Hus, the Lollard *Floretus*, the Prague
Articles, and numerous other Hussite libels and manifestos. I see nothing similar
here, among the books confiscated from Reinmar of Bielawa's workshop. I see here
almost exclusively medical works. Which are, moreover, mostly, or even entirely,
the property of the Augustinian monastery's scriptorium."
"I repeat," Jan Hofrichter stood up, approached the books laid out on the table.
"I repeat, I am not at all eager for either the episcopal or the papal
inquisition, I do not want to denounce anyone or see anyone sizzling
on the stake. But our own arses are on the line here too. Lest we also be accused because of these books. And what do we
have here? Besides Galen, Pliny, and Strabo? Saladinus de Asculo, *Compendium
aromatorium*. Scribonius Largus, *Compositiones medicamentorum*. Bartholomeus
Anglicus, *De proprietatibus rerum*, Albertus Magnus, *De vegetalibus et plantis*...
Magnus, ha, a name truly worthy of a sorcerer. And here, please, Sabur ben
Sahl... Abu Bekr al-Razi... Pagans! Saracens!"
"These Saracens," Łukasz Frydman explained calmly, examining
his rings, "are taught at Christian universities. As medical
authorities. And your sorcerer is Albertus Magnus, Bishop of Regensburg, a learned theologian."
"So you say? Hmmm... Let's look further... Oh! *Causae et curae*, written
by Hildegard of Bingen. Probably a witch, this Hildegard!"
"Not quite," Father Gall smiled. "Hildegard of Bingen,
prophetess, called the Sibyl of the Rhine. Died in an aura of sanctity."
"Ha. But if you say so... And what is this? John Gerard, *Generall...
Historie... of Plantes*... Interesting, what language is this, Hebrew perhaps. But this is probably
another saint. And here we have *Herbarius*, by Thomas de Bohemia..."
"What did you say?" Father Jakub raised his head. "Thomas the Czech?"
"So it says here."
"Show me. Hmmm... Interesting, interesting... Everything, as it turns out, stays
in the family. And revolves around the family."
"What family?"
"So familial," Łukasz Frydman still seemed interested only
in his rings, "that it couldn't be more so. Thomas the Czech, or Behem, author
of this *Herbarius*, is the great-grandfather of our Reinmar, the lover of other men's wives, who has caused
us so much trouble and bother."
"Tomasz Behem, Tomasz Behem," the mayor furrowed his brow. "Also known as Tomasz the Medic. I've heard of him. He was a friend of one of the dukes... I
don't remember..."
"Duke Henry VI of Wrocław," goldsmith Frydman hastened with a calm explanation. "Indeed, this Tomasz was his friend. He was reportedly
an outstanding
22

scholar, a capable physician. He studied in Padua, Salerno, and Montpellier..."
"They also said," Hofrichter interjected, having for some moments been nodding his head in confirmation
that he too remembered, "that he was a sorcerer and a heretic."
"You're stuck on that sorcery like a leech, Master Jan," the mayor grimaced. "Give it a rest."
"Tomasz Behem," the pastor instructed in a slightly stern voice, "was a clergyman.
A Wrocław canon, then even a suffragan bishop of the diocese. And titular
bishop of Sarepta. He personally knew Pope Benedict XII."
"Various things were also said about that pope," Hofrichter was not about to give up.
"And sorcery has occurred even among prelates. Inquisitor Schwenckefeld,
in his time..."
"Leave it be, finally," Father Jakub cut him off. "Something else should concern us here."
"Indeed," confirmed the goldsmith. "I, for one, know what. Duke Henryk
had no male heir, only three daughters. With the youngest, Małgorzata,
our Father Tomasz allowed himself an affair."
"The Duke allowed it? Was the friendship that strong?"
"The Duke was no longer alive then," the goldsmith explained again. "Duchess Anna
either didn't see what was happening, or didn't want to see. Tomasz Behem
was not yet a bishop then, but he was on excellent terms with the rest of Silesia:
with Henryk the Faithful of Głogów, Casimir of Cieszyn and Frysztat,
Bolko the Small of Świdnica-Jawor, Władysław of Bytom-Koźle, Louis
of Brzeg. For indeed, imagine, gentlemen, someone who not only
visits the Holy Father in Avignon, but can also remove
kidney stones so skillfully that the patient not only still has his prick after the operation, but it even
gets hard. If not every day, then still. Though it may sound like a jest,
I am by no means joking. It is commonly believed that it is thanks to Tomasz
that we still have Piasts in Silesia today.
He helped men and women with equal skill. And also couples, if you gentlemen understand what I mean."
"I'm afraid," said the mayor, "that I don't."
"He could help a couple who were not succeeding in the bedchamber. Now do you understand?"
"Now I do," Jan Hofrichter nodded. "Meaning he probably also
bedded the Wrocław princess according to medical art. Naturally, there was a
child from it."
"Naturally," confirmed Father Jakub. "The matter was handled in the usual fashion.
Małgorzata was locked up with the Poor Clares, the child ended up in Oleśnica, with Duke Konrad. Konrad raised him as a son. Tomasz Behem became an ever greater
figure, everywhere, in Silesia, in Prague with Emperor Charles IV, in Avignon, so the boy's career was assured from childhood. A clerical career, of
23

course. Dependent on what intelligence he displayed. If he were stupid, he would get
a country parish. If he were moderately stupid, he would be made an abbot somewhere with the Cistercians.
If he were wise, a chapter in one of the collegiate churches awaited him."
"How did he turn out?"
"Not stupid. Handsome like his father. And valiant. Before anyone could
do anything, the future priest was already fighting with the Greater Polanders alongside the younger
duke, the future Konrad the Elder. He fought so bravely that there was no choice,
he was knighted. With a fief. Thus died little Father Tymo,
long live Ritter Tymo Behem of Bielawa, von Bielau. Knight Tymo, who soon
made a good match, marrying the youngest daughter of Heidenreich Nostitz."
"Nostitz gave his daughter to a cleric's bastard?"
"The cleric, father of the bastard, had meanwhile become Wrocław's suffragan and Bishop
of Sarepta, knew the Holy Father, advised Wenceslaus IV, and was on familiar
terms with all the Silesian dukes. Old Heidenreich probably offered
him his little daughter himself, and willingly."
"That's possible."
"From the union of Nostitz's daughter with Tymo de Bielau, Henryk and Tomasz were born.
In Henryk, the grandfather's blood evidently spoke, for he became a priest, studied
in Prague, and until his death, quite recent, was a scholastic at Holy Cross
in Wrocław. Tomasz, on the other hand, married Boguszka, daughter of Miksza of Prochowice,
and fathered two children with her. Piotr, called Peterlin, and Reinmar, called
Reynevan. Peterlin, or Parsley, and Reynevan, or Tansy. Such
vegetable-herbal cognomens, I have no idea, whether they придумали them themselves or it was
their father's fancy. He, by the way, if we're on the subject, fell at Tannenberg."
"On whose side?"
"On ours, the Christian side."
Jan Hofrichter nodded, took a sip from his tankard.
"And this Reinmar-Reynevan, who is wont to meddle with other men's wives... What is he
to the Augustinians? An oblate? A converse? A novice?"
"Reinmar Bielau," Father Jakub smiled, "is a medic, trained
in Prague, at Charles University. Even before his studies, the boy learned
at the cathedral school in Wrocław, then he learned the secrets of herbalism from
Świdnica apothecaries and from the Brothers of the Holy Spirit at the Brzeg hospice. It was precisely the Brothers of the Holy Spirit and his uncle
Henryk, the Wrocław scholastic, who placed him with our Augustinians, who specialized in herbal treatment. The boy worked honestly and with heart, proving his vocation,
for the hospital and leper-house. Then, as mentioned, he studied medicine
in Prague, also with his uncle's protection and with money
his uncle had from a canonry.
He evidently applied himself to his studies, because after only two years he was a Bachelor of Arts,
*artium baccalaureus*. He left Prague immediately after... Hmm..."
"Immediately after the defenestration," the mayor was not afraid to finish. "Which clearly
shows that he has nothing to do with the Hussite, that is, heresy."
24

"He has nothing to do with it," goldsmith Frydman confirmed calmly. "I know
this well from my son, who was also studying in Prague at that time."
"It was also very good," Mayor Sachs added, "that Reynevan
returned to Silesia, and good that he came to us, to Oleśnica, not to the Duchy of Ziębice,
where his brother serves as a knight to Duke Jan. He is a good and intelligent boy, though
young, and so skilled in herbal healing that you will find few like him. He cured my wife's
boils, which appeared on her, that is, body, and healed my daughter of a persistent cough.
He gave me a decoction for my eyes, which were festering; it cleared up, as if by magic..."
The mayor fell silent, cleared his throat, and thrust his hands into the fur-lined sleeves of his delia coat.
Jan Hofrichter looked at him sharply.
"This way," he declared, "my head has finally cleared.
About this Reynevan. I know everything now. Though by bastardly means, but of Piast
blood. Son of a bishop. Favorite of dukes. Kinsman of the Nostitzes. Nephew of a
Wrocław collegiate scholastic. A study companion for the sons of the wealthy. On
top of that, as if that weren't enough, a renowned medic, almost a miracle worker, able to
ingratiate himself with the powerful. And what did he cure you of, Reverend Father Jakub?
From what ailment, out of curiosity?"
"Ailments," said the priest coldly, "are no subject for debate. Let us say, then, without details, that he cured me."
"Such a person," added the mayor, "is not worth losing. It's a pity to let such a one
perish in a family feud merely because he forgot himself for a pair of beautiful,
that is, eyes. Let him serve the community. Let him heal, since he knows how..."
"Even," Hofrichter snorted, "using a pentagram on the floor?"
"If he heals," Father Gall said seriously, "if he helps, if he soothes
pain, then even so. Such abilities are a gift from God; the Lord bestows them according to His will
and according to a plan known only to Him. *Spiritus flat, ubi vult*, it is not for us to fathom His ways."
"Amen," concluded the mayor.
"In short," Hofrichter did not give up, "someone like Reynevan
cannot be guilty? Is that it? Eh?"
"Let him who is without sin," Jakub Gall replied with a stony face, "cast
the first stone. And God will judge us all."
For a moment, there was silence, so deep that one could hear the rustling of moths' wings,
beating against the windows. From Świętojańska Street came the drawn-out
and melodious call of the city watchman.
"So then, to summarize," the mayor straightened up behind the table so that his
belly pressed against it, "the Stercza brothers are to blame for the tumult in our town of Oleśnica.
The Sterczas are to blame for the material damage and bodily injuries in the market square.
The Stercza brothers are to blame for the loss of health, and God forbid, the death of His Reverence Prior Ste-
25

inkeller, the Stercza brothers are to blame. They and only they. And what happened to
Niklas von Stercza was an unfortunate, that is, accident. This is how I will present the matter to the Duke,
as soon as he returns. Is there agreement?"
"There is agreement."
"*Consensus omnium.*"
"*Concordi voce.*"
"And if Reynevan should appear somewhere," Pastor Gall added after a moment of silence, "I advise capturing him quietly and locking him up. Here, in our town hall dungeon. For his own safety. Until the matter dies down."
"It would be good," added Łukasz Frydman, examining his rings,
"to do it quickly. Before Tammo Stercza learns of the whole affair."

***

Exiting the town hall straight into the darkness of Świętojańska Street, the merchant Hofrichter caught
a movement out of the corner of his eye on the moonlit wall of the tower, a shifting,
indistinct shape, slightly below the windows of the city trumpeter, and above the windows
of the chamber where the council had just ended. He looked, shielding his eyes from
the interfering light of the lantern carried by his servant. What the devil, he thought,
and immediately crossed himself. What's that crawling on the wall? An eagle-owl? An owl? A bat?
Or perhaps...
Jan Hofrichter shuddered, crossed himself again, pulled his marten-fur cap down over his ears,
wrapped himself in his fur coat, and briskly set off towards home.
He did not see, therefore, how the great wallcreeper spread its wings, flew down
from the windowsill, and silently, like a ghost, like a nocturnal phantom, soared over the rooftops of the city.

***

Apeczko Stercza, lord of Ledna, did not like visiting Sterzendorf castle. The reason was singular and simple—Sterzendorf was the seat of Tammo von Stercza, the head, senior, and patriarch of the clan. Or, as some said—the tyrant, despot,
and tormentor.
The chamber was stuffy. And dark. Tammo von Stercza did not allow the windows to be opened
for fear of catching a draft; the shutters also had to be kept constantly closed, because
the light hurt the cripple's eyes.

26

Apeczko was hungry. And dusty from his journey. But there was no time for a meal,
nor for tidying up. Old Stercza did not like to wait. Nor was he accustomed to offering hospitality
to guests. Especially family.
Apeczko therefore swallowed saliva to moisten his throat—nothing to drink had been offered
him, of course—and recounted the Oleśnica events to Tammo. He did so
reluctantly, but well, he had to. Cripple or not, paralytic or not, Tammo was the senior
of the clan. A senior who did not tolerate disobedience.
The old man listened to the account, sprawled in his chair in his usual, unbelievably awkward posture. The old twisted gingerbread man, thought Apeczko. The damned broken old codger.³
The causes of the state in which the patriarch of the Stercza clan found himself were not entirely and not to everyone known. There was agreement on one thing—Tammo had suffered
a stroke, because Tammo had become enraged. Some claimed that the old man had become enraged at
the news that his personal enemy, the hated Duke Konrad of Wrocław, had received
episcopal consecration and become the most powerful figure in Silesia.
Still others asserted that the fateful outburst was caused by his mother-in-law, Anna of Pogorzela, who had burned Tammo's favorite dish—buckwheat groats with cracklings. How it really
was, one could not guess, but the result was visible and unmissable.
After the incident, Stercza could only move—clumsily at that—his left hand and left
foot. His right eyelid was always drooped; from under his left, which he could sometimes
manage to raise, slimy tears constantly flowed, and saliva trickled from the corner
of his lips, contorted into a nightmarish grimace. The incident also caused an almost complete loss of speech,
hence the old man's nickname—Balbulus. The Stutterer-Babbler.
The loss of the ability to speak did not, however, entail what the
entire family had hoped for—loss of contact with the world. Oh, no. The lord of Sterzendorf still
held the clan in his fist and was a terror to all, and what he had to say,
he said. For he always had someone at hand who could understand and translate
his gurgles, croaks, babbling, and shouts into human language. This someone was
usually a child—one of Balbulus's numerous grandchildren or great-grandchildren.
Now the translator was ten-year-old Ofka von Baruth, who, sitting at
the old man's feet, was dressing a doll in scraps of colorful rags.
"So then," Apeczko Stercza finished his story and, clearing his throat,
moved on to the conclusion, "Wolfher, through a messenger, asked to inform you that he will deal with the matter
swiftly. That Reinmar Bielau will be captured on the Wrocław road
and will suffer punishment. Now, however, Wolfher's hands are tied,
because the Duke of Oleśnica is traveling on that road with his entire court and various important ecclesiastical persons, so there is no
way... No way to conduct a pursuit. But Wolfher swears that he will catch Reynevan. That
the honor of the clan can be entrusted to him."
Balbulus's eyelid twitched, a trickle of saliva escaped his lips.
"Bbbhh-bhh-bhh-bhubhu-bhhuaha-rrhhha-phhh- aaa-rrh!" echoed
in the room. "Bbb... hrrrh-urrrhh-bhuuh! Guggu-ggu..."
27

"Wolfher is a fucking idiot," translated Ofka von Baruth in a thin, melodious
voice. "A fool to whom I wouldn't even entrust a bucket of vomit. And the only thing he's capable of catching is his own prick."
"Father..."
"Bbb... brrrh! Bhhrhuu-phr-rrrhhh!"
"Silence," she translated, without raising her head, busy with Ofka's doll. "Listen
to what I say. What I order."
Apeczko patiently waited out the croaks and screeches, and waited for the translation.
"First, Apecz, you shall ascertain," Tammo Stercza commanded through the
girl's mouth, "which woman from Bierutów was entrusted with guarding the Burgundian.
Which one didn't catch on to the true purpose of those charitable excursions to
Oleśnica. Or was in cahoots with the strumpet. Thirty-five lashes with a molded rod for the woman. On her bare arse. Here, before my eyes. Let me at least have that
little bit of joy."
Apeczko Stercza nodded. Balbulus coughed, croaked, and spat all over himself.
Then he contorted his face hideously and cackled.
"As for the Burgundian," translated Ofka, combing the doll's tow hair
with a small card, "whom I already know has taken refuge with the Cistercian nuns of Ligota, I order
her to be extracted from there, even if it means storming the convent. Then lock
the harlot up with monks favorable to us, for example in..."
Tammo abruptly stopped stuttering and gurgling; the rasping died in his throat.
Apeczko, pierced by a bloodshot eye, understood that the old man had noticed his embarrassed expression. That he had caught on. The truth could no longer be hidden.
"The Burgundian," he stammered, "managed to escape from Ligota. Secretly... No one knows where.
Busy with the pursuit... We... didn't keep an eye on her..."
"Interesting," Ofka translated after a long, heavy silence, "interesting,
why this doesn't surprise me at all. But if so, then so be it. I won't
bother my head with the whore. Let Gelfrad deal with this matter when he returns. Let
him deal with the matter himself. His horns don't concern me. It's nothing
new in this family, anyway. I myself must have been well cuckolded. For it cannot be that
such fools were born from my own loins."
Balbulus coughed, croaked, and choked for a few moments. But Ofka did not translate; it was not speech, but an ordinary cough. Finally, the old man rasped, took a breath, contorted his face like a demon, and banged his staff on the floor, after which he gurgled wildly. Ofka listened, putting the end of her braid in her mouth.
"But Niklas," she translated, "was the hope of this clan. My true blood,
the blood of the Sterczas, not some watered-down stuff from God knows what mongrel connections. It cannot be, therefore, that the murderer does not pay for his spilled blood. And with
interest."
Tammo again slammed his staff on the floor. The stick fell from his trembling
hand. The lord of Sterzendorf coughed and sneezed, spitting
and snotting. Standing
28

beside him, Hrozwita von Baruth, Balbulus's daughter, Ofka's mother, wiped his chin,
picked up the staff, and pressed it into his hand.
"Hgrrrhhh! Grhhh... Bbb... bhrr... bhrrrllg..."
"Reinmar Bielau will pay me for Niklas," Ofka translated dispassionately.
"He will pay, God is my witness and all the saints. I'll throw him in the dungeon, in a cage,
in a chest like the one the Głogów people locked Henry the Fat in, with one
hole for food and another for the opposite, so that he can't even scratch himself.
And I'll keep him like that for half a year. And only then will I get to him. And I'll send for
an executioner all the way to Magdeburg, because they have excellent executioners there, not like
these ones here, in Silesia, where the delinquent dies on the second day of torture. Oh no, I'll
bring a master who will dedicate a week to Niklas's murderer. Or two."
Apeczko Stercza swallowed.
"But to be able to do that, the gosling must be caught. And that requires a head.
Reason. Because the gosling is not stupid. A stupid person would not become a bachelor in Prague, would not
insinuate himself into the graces of the Oleśnica monks. And would not have managed to so gracefully
get to Gelfrad's Frenchwoman. Chasing such a clever fellow like
a fool along the Wrocław road, making a laughingstock of oneself, is not enough. Giving the matter publicity,
which will serve the gosling, not us."
Apeczko nodded. Ofka looked at him, twitched her upturned nose.
"The gosling," she continued translating, "has a brother, living on a fief somewhere
near Henryków. It is quite probable that he will seek refuge there. Perhaps
he already has. Another Bielau was, while he lived, a cleric at the Wrocław collegiate church,
so it is not out of the question that the scoundrel will want to take refuge with a scoundrel. I meant to say,
with His Reverence Bishop Konrad. The old drunkard and thief!"
Hrozwita Baruth again wiped the old man's chin, snotty with anger.
"The gosling also has acquaintances among the Brothers of the Holy Spirit in Brzeg. In the hospice. That's
precisely where our clever fellow might have gone, to surprise and mislead Wolfher. Which is not,
by the way, a difficult task. And finally, most importantly, listen up, Apecz.
I'm certain that our gosling will want to play the troubadour, pretend to be some damned Lohengrin
or another Lancelot... He will want to get close to the Frenchwoman. And there, in Ligota,
we will most likely get him, like a dog at a bitch in heat."
"How so, in Ligota?" Apeczko dared to ask. "But she..."
"She escaped, I know. But he doesn't know."
The old fool, thought Apeczko, his soul is even more twisted than his body. But cunning as a fox. And he knows, one must give him credit, a lot. Everything.
"But for what I just said," Ofka translated into human language, "you
are poorly suited, my sons and nephews, blood, supposedly, of my blood
and bone of my bone. Therefore, with all haste, you will go first to Niemodlin, and then
to Ziębice. There... Listen well, Apecz. You will find Kunz Aulock, called
Kyrieleison. And others: Walter de Barby, Sybko of Kobylagłowa, Stork of Gorgo-
29

wic. Tell them that Tammo Stercza pays a thousand Rhenish florins for Reinmar von Bielau, alive. A thousand, remember."
Apeczko swallowed hard at each name. For these were the names of the worst
thugs and murderers in almost all of Silesia, scoundrels without honor or faith.
Ready to murder their own grandmother for three *skojec*, let alone for the fabulous sum of a thousand
guilders. My guilders, thought Apeczko angrily. Because that should be my
inheritance, after this accursed cripple finally kicks the bucket.
"Did you understand, Apecz?"
"Yes, Father."
"Then away, get out of here. Go, on your way, carry out what I have commanded."
First, thought Apeczko, on my way to the kitchen, where I'll eat and drink
for two. You stingy old man. And then we'll see.
"Apecz."
Apeczko Stercza turned. And looked. But not at Balbulus's contorted and bloodshot face, which not for the first time seemed to him, here in Sterzendorf, something unnatural, unnecessary, something out of place. Apeczko
looked into little Ofka's large hazel eyes. At Hrozwita, standing behind the chair.
"Yes, father?"
"Don't fail us."
Or maybe, it flashed through his mind, it's not him at all? Maybe he's no longer here,
maybe a husk is sitting in that chair, a half-corpse, whose brain has already been completely devoured by paralysis? Maybe it's... them? Maybe the women—very young, young, middle-aged, and old
—are ruling Sterzendorf?
He quickly banished this absurd thought from his mind.
"I will not fail. Father."

***

Apeczko Stercza had no intention of hurrying to carry out his orders. He briskly
went, muttering angrily, to the castle kitchen, where he ordered
everything the said kitchen had at its disposal. This included the remains of a deer
haunch, fatty pork ribs, a large coil of blood sausage, a piece of dried
Prague ham, and several pigeons boiled in broth. To this, a whole loaf of bread, large
as a Saracen shield. To this, of course, wines, the best ones, Hungarian
and Moldavian, which Balbulus kept only for his own use. But the paralytic could
be master in his chamber upstairs; outside the chamber, executive power belonged
to someone else. Outside the chamber, Apeczko Stercza was the master.
Apeczko felt like the master and immediately upon entering the kitchen showed that he was.
A dog earned a kick and fled yelping. A cat fled, gracefully avoiding the trajectory
30

of a ladle thrown after it. The serving women practically sat down when an iron pot
crashed onto the stone floor with an indescribable bang. The most sluggish serving woman
got a clout on the neck and learned that she was a whorish good-for-nothing. The servants also learned very various things
about themselves and their mothers, and several became acquainted with the master's fist, hard and heavy as solid iron. The one to whom the order
to bring wines from the master's cellar had to be repeated, received such a kick
that he set off on all fours.
Shortly thereafter, Apeczko—Master Apeczko—sprawled at the table, ate greedily
and in large bites, drank Moldavian and Hungarian wine alternately, threw
bones onto the floor in a lordly manner, spat, belched, and from under his brow eyed
the fat housekeeper, just waiting for her to give him a pretext.
The old gingerbread man, the dotard, the paralytic, makes me call him father, yet he's only
my uncle, my father's brother. But I must endure it. Because when he finally kicks
the bucket, I, the eldest Stercza, will finally become head of the clan. The inheritance,
of course, will have to be divided, but I will be head of the clan. Everyone knows it. Nothing will stop me, nothing can...
Stop me, Apeczko cursed under his breath, this mess with Reynevan and Gelfrad's wife can stop me. A family feud, meaning clashing with the *Landfrieden*, can stop me. Hiring thugs and murderers can stop me. The noisy pursuit, imprisonment in a dungeon, maltreatment and torture of a boy who is a relative
of the Nostitzes and related by marriage to the Piasts. And a vassal of Jan of Ziębice. And the Bishop of Wrocław, Konrad, who loves Balbulus as much as Balbulus loves him, is just waiting
for an opportunity to get at the Sterczas' arses.
Not good, not good, not good.
And all of this, Apeczko suddenly decided, picking his teeth, is Reynevan's fault, Reinmar of Bielawa. And he will pay for it. But not in a way that would stir up all of Silesia.
He will pay simply, quietly, in the dark, with a knife between the ribs.
Then, when—as Balbulus shrewdly guessed—he secretly appears in Ligota,
at the Cistercian convent, under the window of his mistress, Gelfrad's Adela. One
knife thrust, plop into the Cistercian carp pond. And hush. As quiet as a carp.
On the other hand, Balbulus's orders cannot be completely disregarded. If only
for the reason that the Babbler was accustomed to controlling the execution of his
orders. Entrusting their execution not to one, but to several people.
So what to do, by the devil?
Apeczko slammed his knife into the tabletop with a bang, drained his cup in one gulp.
He raised his head, met the gaze of the fat housekeeper.
"What are you staring at?" he snarled.
"The old master," the housekeeper said calmly, "recently brought in
some excellent Italian wine. Shall I have some drawn, noble sir?"
"Indeed," Apeczko smiled despite himself, felt the woman's calmness
transfer to him. "Indeed, please, have some drawn, we shall taste what
has matured in Italy.
31

Send a boy to the watchtower, please, let one who is a good rider and has a head on his shoulders
present himself here on one leg. Someone who can deliver a message."
"As you command, noble sir."

***

Hooves clattered on the bridge; the messenger leaving Sterzendorf looked back,
waved to his woman, who was bidding him farewell from the rampart with a little white kerchief.
And suddenly the messenger caught a movement on the moonlit wall of the watchtower, a shifting,
indistinct shape. What the devil, he thought, what's that crawling there? An eagle-owl? An owl? A bat?
Or perhaps...
The messenger muttered a charm against the evil eye, spat into the moat, and spurred his horse.
The message he carried was urgent. And the master who had entrusted it to him was stern.
He did not see, therefore, how the great wallcreeper spread its wings and, silent as
a ghost, like a nocturnal phantom, soared over the forests to the west, towards the Widawa valley.

***

Sensenberg Castle, as everyone knew, was built by the Templars, and not without reason did they choose this very spot, and no other. The mountain peak, rising above a jagged
precipice, was in ancient times a place of worship for pagan gods; a *kacina* (pagan shrine) stood here,
where, according to legends, the ancient inhabitants of these lands, the Trzebowianie and Bobrzanie, offered human sacrifices to their deities. In times
when only circles of round, moss-covered stones, hidden among weeds, remained
of the *kacina*, the pagan cult continued to spread; Midsummer fires still
burned on the summit. As late as 1189, Bishop Żyrosław of Wrocław threatened severe punishments to those
who dared to celebrate the *festum dyabolicum et maledictum* on Sensenberg. Nearly a hundred years later, Bishop Wawrzyniec still imprisoned those
who celebrated it.
Meanwhile, as mentioned, the Templars arrived. They built their Silesian
castles, menacing and jagged miniatures of Syrian kraks, erected under the supervision
of men with heads wrapped in cloths and faces as dark as tanned bullhide.
It could not have been a coincidence that sacred places of ancient, fading
cults were always chosen for the locations of fortresses—like Mała Oleśnica,
Otmęt, Rogów, Habendorf, Fischbach, Peterwitz, Owiesno, Lipa, Braciszowa
Góra, Srebrna Góra, Kaltenstein. And, of course, Sensenberg.
32

Then, however, the Templars' time came. Justly or not, it's futile to argue,
but an end was made of them, everyone knows how it was. Their castles were taken over
by the Joannites, quickly enriching monasteries and rapidly rising
Silesian magnates scrambled for them. Some, despite the power slumbering
at their roots, fell into ruin with extraordinary speed. Ruins that were avoided, bypassed.
Ruins that were feared.
Not without reason.
Despite rapidly advancing colonization, despite settlers hungry for land pouring in
from Saxony, Thuringia, the Rhineland, and Franconia, Sensenberg mountain and castle
were still surrounded by a wide belt of no-man's-land, a wasteland into which only
a poacher or a fugitive would venture. It was from them, poachers and fugitives, that
tales were first heard of uncanny birds, of nightmarish riders, of lights flickering
in the castle windows, of wild and cruel cries
and songs, of ghostly organ music seeming to emanate from beneath the earth.
There were those who did not believe. There were also those who were lured by the Templar treasure,
supposedly still lying somewhere in the Sensenberg dungeons. There were ordinary curious folk
and restless spirits.
They did not return.

***

That night, if any poacher, fugitive, or adventurer had been in the vicinity of Sensenberg,
the mountain and castle would have given rise to further legends. A storm was approaching from beyond the horizon,
the sky flared every now and then with the light of distant lightning,
so distant that not even the rumble of thunder could be heard. And the black block of the castle against the flashing
sky suddenly blazed with the bright eyes of its windows.
For within the apparent ruin was a large, high-vaulted knights' hall.
The candelabra, chandeliers, and torches burning in iron sconces that illuminated it
drew frescoes from the gloom on the rough walls. The frescoes depicted
knightly and religious scenes. Thus, Percival, kneeling
before the Grail, and Moses, bringing down the stone tablets from Mount Sinai, looked upon the enormous round
table standing in the middle of the hall. Roland in the battle of Albracca and Saint Boniface, dying
a martyr's death by Frisian swords. Godfrey de Bouillon, entering
conquered Jerusalem. And Jesus, falling for the second time beneath the cross. All of them looked
with their somewhat Byzantine eyes at the table and at the knights seated
around it in full armor and hooded cloaks.
Through an open window, a large wallcreeper flew in on a gust of wind.
The bird circled, casting a ghostly shadow on the frescoes, landed, ruffling
its feathers, on the back of one of the chairs. It opened its beak and screeched, and before the screeching
33

had faded, a knight was sitting on the chair, no longer a bird. In a cloak and hood,
twin-like to the others.
"*Adsumus*," the Wallcreeper spoke hollowly. "We are here, Lord, gathered
in Your name. Come to us and be among us."
"*Adsumus*," repeated the knights gathered at the table in one voice. "*Adsumus! Adsumus!*"
The echo ran through the castle like rumbling thunder, like the sound of a distant battle,
like the crash of a battering ram against a fortress gate. And it faded slowly among the dark corridors.
"Glory to the Lord," spoke the Wallcreeper when silence fell. "Near is
the day when all his enemies will lie in dust. Woe to them! That is why we are here!"
"*Adsumus!*"
"Providence," the Wallcreeper raised its head, and its eyes gleamed with the reflected light of a flame, "sends us, my brothers, another opportunity to strike
the Lord's enemies again and once more crush the foes of the faith. The time has come to deliver another blow! Remember, O brothers, this name: Reinmar of Bielawa. Reinmar
of Bielawa, called Reynevan. Listen..."
The hooded knights leaned forward, listening. Jesus, falling
under the cross, looked at them from the fresco, and in his Byzantine eyes was an immensity of very human suffering.

Chapter 3
which discusses things seemingly so little related to each other
as hawking, the Piast dynasty, cabbage with peas,
and the Bohemian heresy. As well as a dispute about whether, to whom, and when one should keep one's word.

Above the Oleśniczka river, winding amidst black alder carr, clumps of white birches, and green meadows, on a rise from which the thatched roofs and smoke of Borowa village were visible, the ducal procession made a longer halt. But not to rest.
Quite the contrary. To tire themselves out. That is, to amuse themselves in a lordly fashion.
As they rode up, flocks of birds rose from the wetlands—ducks, teals,
pochards, pintails, even herons. At this sight, Duke Konrad Kantner, lord of
Oleśnica, Trzebnica, Milicz, Ścinawa, Wołów, and Smogorzewo, and jointly with his brother Konrad the White also of Koźle, immediately ordered the procession to halt
and to be given his favorite falcons. The Duke was almost maniacally fond of hawking.
Oleśnica and its finances could wait, the Bishop of Wrocław could wait,
politics could wait, all of Silesia and the whole world could wait—for
the Duke to see his favorite Raby tear feathers from mallards,
and to convince himself that Srebrny would be valiant in aerial combat with a heron.
The Duke therefore galloped through the reeds and meadows like one possessed, and with him—
equally bravely, though somewhat reluctantly—his eldest daughter Agnieszka, seneschal
Rudiger Haugwitz, and several careerist pages.
The rest of the procession waited at the edge of the forest. Without dismounting, for no one
could know when the Duke would tire of it. The Duke's foreign guest yawned discreetly.
The chaplain muttered—probably a prayer, the chamberlain counted—probably money,
the minnesinger composed—probably rhymes, Princess Agnieszka's ladies-in-waiting
gossiped—probably about other ladies, and the young knights killed boredom by riding around
and exploring the surrounding thickets.
"Ciołek!" (Bull-calf!)

35

Henryk Krompusz reined in his horse and turned it, much surprised, then pricked up his ears, trying
to determine which of the bushes had just quietly called him
by his own familiar nickname.
"Ciołek!"
"Who's there? Show yourself!"
The bushes rustled.
"Saint Hedwig..." Krompusz's jaw dropped in astonishment. "Reynevan? Is that you?"
"No, Saint Hedwig," Reynevan replied in a voice as sour as gooseberries
in May. "Ciołek, I need help... Whose procession is this? Kantner's?"
Before Krompusz, to whom it was finally beginning to sink in, could react, two other
Oleśnica knights joined him.
"Reynevan!" Jaksa of Wisznia groaned. "Christ Almighty, look at you!"
Interesting, thought Reynevan, how you would look if your horse had died just
past Bystre. If you had to wander all night through the bogs and wilderness of
the Świerzna, and then in the morning exchange your wet and muddy rags for a smock filched from a village fence. Interesting, how you would look after something like that,
you preening fop.
The third Oleśnica knight, Benno Ebersbach, who was watching them with a rather grim expression,
probably thought something similar.
"Instead of gawking," he said dryly, "give him some clothes.
Take off those rags, Bielau. Come on, gentlemen, pull out
whatever you have from your saddlebags."
"Reynevan," it was still dawning slowly on Krompusz. "Is that you?"
Reynevan didn't answer. He pulled on the shirt and doublet thrown to him. He was so
angry he was close to tears.
"I need help..." he repeated. "I need it very badly."
"We see and we know," Ebersbach confirmed with a nod. "And we too
are of the opinion that very much so. Very much indeed. Come. You must be shown
to Haugwitz. And to the Duke."
"Does he know?"
"Everyone knows. The matter is widely known."

***

If Konrad Kantner, with his gaunt face, forehead elongated by baldness,
black beard, and piercing monk's eyes, did not much resemble a typical
representative of the dynasty, then in the case of his daughter Agnieszka, there could be no
doubt—this little apple had not fallen far from the Silesian-Masovian
apple tree.
36

The princess had flaxen hair, light eyes, and a small, upturned, cheerful Piast nose, already immortalized by the famous sculpture in Naumburg Cathedral. Agnieszka
Kantnerówna, as Reynevan quickly calculated, was about fifteen years old, so she must
already have been betrothed to someone. Reynevan didn't remember the gossip.
"Stand up."
He stood.
"Know," spoke the Duke, piercing him with a fiery gaze, "that I
do not approve of your deed. Nay, I consider it vile, reprehensible, and culpable. And I sincerely advise you repentance and penance, Reinmar Bielau. My chaplain assures me
that there is a special enclave in hell for adulterers. Demons severely torment
sinners there on the instrument of their sin. I will not go into details out of consideration for the presence
of a young lady."
Seneschal Rudiger Haugwitz snorted angrily. Reynevan remained silent.
"What atonement you will give Gelfrad von Stercza," Kantner continued,
"that is your affair and his. I will not meddle in this matter, especially since you
are both vassals not of mine, but of Duke Jan of Ziębice. And in principle, I should
send you off to Ziębice. Having washed my hands of it."
Reynevan swallowed.
"But," the Duke continued after a moment of dramatic silence, "I am not Pilate,
that's one. Two, out of regard for your father, who laid down his life
at Tannenberg alongside my brother, I will not allow you to be murdered in a foolish family feud. Three, it is generally high time to put an end to family feuds
and live as befits Europeans. That is all. I permit you to travel in my retinue even all the way to Wrocław. But do not show your face to me. For
your sight does not please my eyes."
"Your Ducal..."
"Leave, I said."
The hunt was definitively over. The falcons had their hoods put on, the hunted ducks and herons were tenderizing, tied to the cart's racks, the Duke was pleased, his retinue too, because the chase, which threatened to be long, did not last long at all. Reynevan caught several clearly grateful glances—word had spread through the retinue that it was because of him that the Duke had cut short the hunt and resumed the journey. Reynevan had justified fears that not only that had spread.
His ears burned as if he were being reprimanded.
"Everyone," he grumbled to Benno Ebersbach, riding beside him, "knows everything..."
"Everyone," the Oleśnica knight confirmed, not at all cheerfully. "But, fortunately for you,
not everything."
"Huh?"
"Are you playing the fool, Bielau?" Ebersbach asked, without raising his voice. "Kantner
would surely have driven you away, and perhaps even sent you in fetters to the castellan, if he
37

knew that a corpse had fallen in Oleśnica. Yes, yes, don't stare at me like that. Young
Niklas von Stercza is dead. Gelfrad's horns are Gelfrad's horns, but the Sterczas
will never forgive you for their killed brother."
"With a finger..." Reynevan said after a series of deep breaths. "I didn't even touch
Niklas with a finger. I swear."
"To complete the picture," Ebersbach was visibly unimpressed by the oath, "beautiful
Adela accused you of witchcraft. Of bewitching her and taking advantage of her
when she was helpless."
"Even if that's true," Reynevan replied after a short pause, "she
was forced to do it. Threatened with death. They have her in their hands, after all..."
"They don't," Ebersbach denied. "From the Augustinians, where she publicly
accused you of diabolical practices, beautiful Adela fled to Ligota. Behind the gate
of the Cistercian convent."
Reynevan breathed a sigh of relief.
"I don't believe," he repeated, "those accusations. She loves me. And I love
her."
"Beautifully."
"And you should know, it is beautiful."
"Truly beautiful," Ebersbach looked him in the eyes, "it became, however,
when they searched your workshop."
"Ha. I was afraid of that."
"And rightly so. In my humble opinion, the only reason you don't have the
Inquisition on your tail already is that they haven't finished inventorying the deviltries they found at your place. Kantner might protect you from the Sterczas, but hardly from the Inquisition.
When word of this sorcery spreads, he himself will hand you over to them. Don't go
with us to Wrocław, Reynevan. Break away earlier and flee, hide somewhere.
I'm giving you good advice."
Reynevan didn't answer.
"And by the way," Ebersbach threw out casually. "Do you actually know
magic? Because, you see, I recently met a young lady... Well... How should I put it...
An elixir would come in handy..."
Reynevan didn't answer. A shout came from the head of the procession.
"What is it?"
"Byków," Ciołek Krompusz guessed, urging his horse on. "The 'Under the Gander' Inn."
"And praise be to God," Jaksa of Wisznia added under his breath, "for I'm terribly hungry
after all this damned hunting."
Reynevan, this time too, did not answer. The drawn-out rumbling emanating from his bowels
was more than eloquent.
The "Under the Gander" inn was large and probably well-known, for there were many
guests, both local and travelers, which could be judged by the horses, carts, and the servants and armed men bustling around them. When Duke
38

Kantner's retinue rode into the courtyard with great style and noise, the innkeeper
was already forewarned. He burst out of the entrance like a cannonball, scattering
poultry and splashing dung. He shifted from foot to foot and bowed deeply.
"Welcome, welcome, God be in this house," he panted. "What an honor, what a privilege,
that Your Serene Grace..."
"It's rather crowded here today," Kantner dismounted from the bay held by servants. "Whom are you hosting? Who is emptying the pots here? Will there be enough
for us too?"
"Undoubtedly there will be enough, undoubtedly," the innkeeper assured, struggling to catch
his breath. "And it's not crowded at all anymore... I drove out the rabble, goliards, and peasants...
just as I saw Your Graces on the highway. The main room is quite free
now, the alcove is also free, only..."
"Only what?" Rudiger Haugwitz raised his eyebrows.
"Guests in the room. Important and ecclesiastical persons... Envoys. I dared not..."
"It's good then," Kantner interrupted, "that you didn't dare. You would have shown disrespect to me
and all of Oleśnica if you had dared. Guests are guests! And I am a Piast, not a Saracen
sultan; it's no shame for me to eat together with guests. Lead on, gentlemen."
In the somewhat smoky room, filled with the smell of cabbage, it was indeed not
crowded. In truth, only one table was occupied, at which sat three
men. All had tonsures. Two wore attire characteristic of clergy on a journey, but so rich that they could not have been any ordinary parish priests.
The third wore the habit of a Dominican.
At the sight of Kantner entering, the clergymen rose from the bench. The one whose
attire was richest bowed, but without excessive humility.
"Your Grace, Duke Konrad," he spoke, demonstrating good information, "indeed, it is a great honor for us. I am, with your permission, Maciej Korzbok, official of the Poznań diocese, on a mission to Wrocław, to
Your Ducal Grace's brother, Bishop Konrad, commissioned by His Most Reverend
Lordship Bishop Andrzej Łaskarz. And these are my travel companions, also
journeying from Gniezno to Wrocław: Sir Melchior Barfuss, vicar of His Reverence
Krzysztof Rotenhahn, Bishop of Lubusz. And the Reverend Jan Nejedly
of Vysoké, Prior of the Ordo Praedicatorum, traveling on a mission from the Kraków
provincial of the order."
The Brandenburger and the Dominican bowed their tonsured heads; Konrad Kantner responded
with a slight movement of his head.
"Your Eminence, Your Reverences," he spoke nasally. "It will be a pleasure for me
to dine in such esteemed company. And to converse. And as for conversation, if
it does not weary the reverend gentlemen, we shall have enough both here and on the road, for I too am
journeying to Wrocław, with my daughter... Come here, Anežka... Bow
before the servants of Christ."

The princess curtsied, bowed her little head with the intention of kissing his hand, but Maciej Korzbok stopped her, blessed her with a quick sign of the cross over her flaxen
fringe. The Czech Dominican folded his hands, bowed his neck, mumbled a short prayer, adding
something about *clarissima puella*.
"And this," Kantner continued, "is Seneschal Rudiger Haugwitz. And these are my
knights and my guest..."
Reynevan felt a tug on his sleeve. He obeyed Krompusz's gestures and hisses,
and went out with him into the courtyard, where the commotion caused by the Duke's arrival
still continued. Ebersbach was waiting in the courtyard.
"I've made inquiries," he said. "They were here yesterday. Wolfher Stercza, with five others.
I also questioned those Greater Polanders. The Sterczas stopped them, but dared not
impose themselves on ecclesiastical persons. But it's clear they're looking for you along the Wrocław highway.
I'd flee if I were you."
"Kantner," Reynevan mumbled, "will protect me..."
Ebersbach shrugged.
"Your will. And your skin. Wolfher is very loudly and in detail
describing what he'll do to you when he catches you. If I were you..."
"I love Adela and I will not abandon her!" Reynevan burst out. "That's first!
And second... Where on earth would I flee? To Poland? Or perhaps to
Samogitia?"
"Quite a good idea. The one about Samogitia, that is."
"Plague take it!" Reynevan kicked a hen clucking at his feet. "Alright. I'll think.
And I'll come up with something. But first, I'll eat something. I'm dying of hunger, and the smell of this cabbage
is killing me."
It was high time; another moment, and the youths would have gone hungry.
Pots of groats and cabbage with peas, and bowls of pork bones with meat,
were placed on the main table, before the Duke and Princess. The dishes traveled to
the ends of the tables only after the three clergymen seated closest to Kantner,
who, as it turned out, could eat quite a bit, had had their fill. Along the way, to make matters
worse, there was Rudiger Haugwitz, who could eat no less, and the Duke's foreign guest,
a dark-haired knight with shoulders even broader than Haugwitz's, his face so swarthy
as if he had just returned from the Holy Land. Thus, in the bowls that
reached those of lower rank and younger age, almost nothing remained. Fortunately,
a moment later, the innkeeper served the Duke a large platter of capons, which looked
and smelled so delicious that the cabbage and pork fat lost some of their
appeal and reached the ends of the tables in an almost untouched state.
Agnieszka Kantnerówna nibbled at a capon leg with her little teeth, trying to protect
the fashionably slit sleeves of her dress from dripping fat. The men
discussed this and that. It was now the turn of one of the clergymen, that
Dominican, Jan Nejedly of Vysoké.

"I am," the aforementioned perorated, "or rather, I was prior at Saint
Clement's in the Old Town of Prague. Item, a master of Charles University.
Now, as you see, I am an exile, dependent on others' charity and bread. My
monastery was plundered, and in the academy, as you can easily guess,
I did not get along with apostates and scoundrels like Jan Příbram, Kristián of Prachatice,
and Jakoubek of Stříbro, may God punish them..."
"We have here," Kantner interjected, catching Reynevan's eye, "one
student from Prague. *Scholarus academiae pragensis, artium baccalaureus*."
"I would advise then," the Dominican's eyes flashed over his spoon, "to
keep a careful watch on him. I am far from making accusations, but heresy
is like soot, like tar. Like dung! Whoever lingers nearby must
get soiled."
Reynevan quickly lowered his head, feeling his ears flush again and blood
rush to his cheeks.
"Nonsense," laughed the Duke, "our scholar has nothing to do with heresy. He's from
a decent family, training to be a priest and a medic at the Prague university. Right,
Reinmar?"
"With your grace's permission," Reynevan swallowed, "I no longer study in Prague.
On my brother's advice, I left Charles University in the year '19, shortly after Saints Abdon and Sennen's Day... That is, right after the defenes... Well, you know when. Now I think
I might try to study in Kraków... Or Leipzig, where most
of the Prague masters fled... I won't return to Bohemia. As long as the unrest continues."
"Unrest!" A few strands of cabbage flew from the excited Czech's mouth and landed on his scapular. "A fine word, indeed! You here, in a peaceful country, cannot even imagine what heresy is doing in Bohemia, what
monstrosities that unfortunate country is witnessing. Incited by heretics, Wycliffites, Waldensians, and other servants of Satan, the rabble has turned its thoughtless fury
against the faith and the Church. In Bohemia, God is being destroyed and His temples burned.
Servants of God are being murdered!"
"News is reaching us," confirmed Melchior Barfuss, vicar of the Bishop of Lubusz, licking his fingers, "truly terrible things. It's hard to believe..."
"And you must believe!" Jan Nejedly shouted even louder. "For no
news is exaggerated!"
Beer splashed from his tankard; Agnieszka Kantnerówna instinctively recoiled,
shielding herself, like a shield, with the capon leg.
"Do you want examples? I can provide them! Massacres of monks in Český Brod and Pomuk, murdered Cistercians in Zbraslav, Velehrad, and Mnichovo
Hradiště, murdered Dominicans in Písek, Benedictines in Kladruby and Postoloprty, murdered innocent Premonstratensian nuns in Chotěšov, murdered priests in Český Brod and Jaroměř, plundered and burned monasteries in Kolín, Milevsko, and Zlatá Koruna, desecrated altars and images of saints
in Břevnov and Vodňany... And what did Žižka do, that rabid dog, that
41

antichrist and spawn of the devil? Bloody massacres in Chomutov and Prachatice, forty
priests burned alive in Beroun, burned monasteries in Sázava and Vilémov,
sacrileges that even a Turk would not commit, heinous crimes and cruelties,
bestialities at the sight of which a Saracen would tremble! Oh, truly, God, how long
will You not judge and avenge our blood?
The silence, in which only the murmur of the Oleśnica chaplain's prayer could be heard,
was broken by the deep and resonant voice of the swarthy-faced and broad-shouldered knight,
Duke Konrad Kantner's guest.
"It didn't have to be this way."
"Pardon?" the Dominican raised his head. "What do you mean by that, sir?"
"All of this could have been easily avoided. It was enough not to burn
Jan Hus in Constance."
"You," the Czech narrowed his eyes, "were already there, then, defending the heretic, shouting, protesting, submitting petitions, I know that. And you were wrong then and you are wrong
now. Heresy spreads like cockle, and Holy Scripture commands that weeds be burned with fire.
Papal bulls command..."
"Leave the bulls," the swarthy man cut him off, "for council debates; they sound ridiculous
quoted in an inn. And in Constance, I was right, you can say what you want.
The Luxembourger guaranteed Hus's safety with his royal word and a letter of safe conduct.
He broke his word and oath, thereby staining monarchical and knightly honor.
I could not look upon that calmly. And I did not want to."
"A knight's oath," Jan Nejedly growled, "is to be made in the service of
God, regardless of who swears it, squire or king. Do you call keeping an oath and word to a heretic divine service? Do you call that honor? I call it sin."
"I, if I give it, give my knightly word in the sight of God. That is why I keep it
even to Turks."
"One may keep one's word to Turks. To heretics, one must not."
"Indeed," said Maciej Korzbok, the Poznań official, very seriously. "A Moor
or a Turk languishes in paganism through ignorance and savagery. He can be converted.
An apostate and schismatic, however, turns away from the faith and the Church,
mocks them, blasphemes. Therefore, he is a hundred times more abhorrent to God. And any means of fighting
heresy is good. Indeed, no one who goes after a wolf or a rabid dog will,
if he is in his right mind, discourse on honor and knightly word! Anything is permissible against a heretic."
"In Kraków," Kantner's guest turned his weathered face towards him, "Canon Jan Elgot,
when a heretic needs to be ensnared, holds the seal of confession for naught. Bishop
Andrzej Łaskarz, whom you serve, recommends the same to the priests of the Poznań diocese.
Anything is permissible. Indeed."
"You don't hide your sympathies, sir," Jan Nejedly of Vysoké said sourly.
"So I will not hide mine either. And I repeat: Hus was a heretic and had to go to the stake."
42

The King of the Romans, Hungary, and Bohemia acted rightly, not keeping his word
given to the Czech heretic.
"And for that," the swarthy man retorted, "the Czechs love him so much now. For that
reason he fled from Vyšehrad with the Bohemian crown under his arm. And now he rules
the Czechs, but in Buda, for they won't let him into Hradčany anytime soon."
"You dare mock King Sigismund," observed Melchior Barfuss.
"And yet you serve him."
"Precisely for that reason."
"Or perhaps for some other reason?" the Czech rasped spitefully. "You,
knight, fought against the Hospitallers of Our Lady at Tannenberg on the
side of the Poles. On Jagiełło's side. The neophyte king, who is the clear
author of the Czech heresy and readily lends an ear to schismatics and Wycliffites. Jagiełło's nephew,
the apostate Korybutowicz, is rampaging in Prague as he pleases, Polish
knights in Bohemia are murdering Catholics and plundering monasteries. And though Jagiełło pretends
it's without his will and consent, he himself somehow doesn't march with an army against the heretics!
And if he did, if he allied himself with King Sigismund in a crusade,
the Hussites would be finished in a flash! So why doesn't Jagiełło do it?"
"Precisely," the swarthy man smiled again, and it was a very significant
smile. "Why? Interesting."
Konrad Kantner cleared his throat loudly. Barfuss pretended to be interested only
in the cabbage with peas. Maciej Korzbok bit his lip, nodded with a grim expression.
"What's true," he admitted, "is true. The Roman King has more than once shown that
he is no friend of the Polish Crown. Truly, every Greater Polander, for I can vouch for them,
will willingly stand up in defense of the faith. But only if
the Luxembourger gives a guarantee that if we march south, then neither the Teutonic Knights
nor the Brandenburgers will invade us. And how can he give such a guarantee,
if he is plotting the partition of Poland with them? Am I not right, Duke Konrad?"
"What's there to discuss," Kantner smiled with exceptional insincerity. "We're
politicizing more than necessary, it seems to me. And politics doesn't go hand in hand with food.
Which is getting cold, by the way."
"Precisely, we must speak of this," Jan Nejedly protested, to the delight
of the younger knights, to whom two pots had already arrived almost untouched by
the talkative nobles. The joy was premature; the nobles showed they could
talk and eat simultaneously.
"For consider, noble sirs," he continued, devouring cabbage, the former prior
of Saint Clement's, "this Wycliffite plague is not just a Czech matter. The Czechs,
I know them, are ready to come here too, as they went to Moravia and Austria. They can come
to you, gentlemen. To all of you, as you sit here."
"Pah," Kantner pursed his lips, digging his spoon into the bowl in search of
cracklings. "I won't believe that."

43

"I even less so," Maciej Korzbok snorted with beer foam. "To us, to
Poznań, they have a bit too far to go."
"To Lubusz and Fürstenwalde," Melchior Barfuss said with a full mouth, "is also quite a distance from Tábor. Oh, I'm not afraid."
"All the more so," added the Duke with an unpleasant smile, "that the Czechs themselves
will sooner receive guests than go to anyone. Especially now that Žižka is gone.
I think guests are to be expected any day now, the Czechs should be looking out for them."
"A crusade? Do you know anything, Your Grace?"
"Not at all," Kantner replied with an expression that suggested the opposite. "I'm
just pondering. Innkeeper! Beer!"
Reynevan quietly slipped out into the courtyard, and from the courtyard behind the pigsty and into the bushes behind the vegetable garden. Having relieved himself properly, he returned. But not to the main room. He went
out the gate, looked for a long time at the highway disappearing into a bluish haze. On which,
to his relief, he did not see the Stercza brothers approaching at a gallop.
Adela, he thought suddenly, Adela is not at all safe with the Cistercian nuns of Ligota.
I should...
I should. But I'm afraid. Of what the Sterczas might do to me. Of what
they describe in detail.
He turned back to the courtyard. He was astonished to see Duke Kantner and Haugwitz
emerging briskly and lightly from behind the pigsties. In principle, he thought, why be
surprised. Even dukes and seneschals go into the bushes behind pigsties. And on foot.
"Lend an ear, Bielau," Kantner said brusquely, washing his hands in a bucket
hastily provided by a serving girl. "And listen to what I say. You
will not go with me to Wrocław."
"Your Ducal..."
"Shut your mouth and don't open it until I order you to. I'm doing this for your
own good, you whelp. Because I am more than certain that in Wrocław my brother the bishop
will throw you in the tower faster than you can say *benedictum nomen Iesu*.
Bishop Konrad is very harsh on adulterers, probably, hehehe, he doesn't like competition, hehehe. So you will take this horse I've lent you and ride to Mała
Oleśnica, to the Joannite commandery. Tell Commander Dytmar de Alzey
that I sent you for penance. There you will sit quietly until I summon you. Clear?
It must be clear. And here's a purse for the road. I know it's small. I would have given more, but
my chamberlain advised against it. This inn has strained my entertainment fund too much."
"Many thanks," Reynevan muttered, though the weight of the little purse by no means
deserved thanks. "Great thanks to Your Grace. It's just that..."
"Don't fear the Sterczas," the Duke interrupted. "They won't find you in the Joannite
house, and you won't be alone on the way there. It so happens that my guest is heading
in that direction, towards Moravia. You probably saw him at the table. He agreed
44

for you to accompany him. Frankly speaking, not right away. But I convinced him. Do you want
to know how?"
Reynevan nodded to indicate that he did.
"I told him that your father died in my brother's banner
at Tannenberg. And he was there too. Only, he says: at Grunwald. Because he was on
the opposing side."
"So then, fare thee well. And cheer up, my boy, cheer up. You cannot
complain of my grace. You have a horse, you have money. And your safety
on the journey is assured."
"How assured?" Reynevan dared to mumble. "Your Grace...
Wolfher Stercza rides with five men... And I... With one knight? Even if
with a squire... Your Grace... That's still only one knight!"
Rudiger Haugwitz snorted. Konrad Kantner pursed his lips condescendingly.
"Oh, you're foolish, Bielau. Supposedly a learned bachelor, yet you didn't recognize a famous man. For that knight, you blockhead, six are a trifle."
And seeing that Reynevan still didn't understand, he explained.
"That is Zawisza Czarny of Garbów."
