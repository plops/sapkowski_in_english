**Introduction/Blurb (Pre-Chapter 1)**
*   Introduces the novel "Narrenturm" (The Tower of Fools) by Andrzej Sapkowski.
*   Sets a humorous, slightly chaotic tone: the world hasn't ended, but things are "merry," especially for the protagonist.
*   Introduces Reinmar of Bielawa (Reynevan), an herbalist and medic.
*   Reynevan is having an affair with the beautiful wife of a Silesian knight.
*   The affair is discovered when the knight's kinsmen burst in.
*   Quotes Zawisza Czarny's ominous prediction about Reynevan's unnatural death.
*   Mentions Zawisza Czarny's own fate (beheading by Turks).
*   Hints at more to come in the trilogy.

**Prologue/Narrator's Introduction (Before Chapter 1, after the blurb)**
*   The "End of the World" predicted for 1420 did not happen, despite many signs.
*   The narrator (speaking to an audience in an inn) comments on the general state of the world: wars, plagues, famine, and moral decay persist.
*   Lists prominent deaths and historical events of the early 1420s (Jan Kropidło, Henry V of England, Charles VI of France, Pope Benedict XIII, King Jogajła's marriage and campaign against Teutonic Knights).
*   Highlights cultural achievements of the time (preachers, writers, artists).
*   The narrator expresses caution about discussing Bohemian (Hussite) affairs due to the mixed and potentially dangerous company present (Poles, Czechs, different religious orders).
*   Briefly recounts key events in the Hussite Wars (Jogajła declining the Bohemian crown, Korybutowicz's involvement, Žižka's victories and death).
*   The narrator offers to tell a story about these "dreadful" but "historical" times, warning that its pleasant beginning is deceptive.

**Chapter 1: Reynevan's Tryst and Escape**
*   Reynevan is in bed with Adela von Stercza in an attic room in Oleśnica, near an Augustinian monastery, while monks sing Sext.
*   Details of their amorous encounter, with Reynevan's internal musings and quotes from the Song of Solomon.
*   Background on how Gelfrad von Stercza (Adela's husband) met Adela and how his absence (due to injury on a crusade) facilitated the affair.
*   The Stercza brothers (Wolfher, Wittich, Morold) violently interrupt the lovers.
*   Adela is beaten; Reynevan is attacked. Adela, under duress, accuses Reynevan of using sorcery on her.
*   Augustinian monks, including Prior Erazm Steinkeller and the formidable Brother Innocent, intervene, leading to a larger brawl.
*   Reynevan manages to escape on a horse, pursued by the Sterczas and their allies.
*   A chaotic chase ensues through the streets and market square of Oleśnica.
*   During the pursuit, the youngest Stercza brother, Niklas, accidentally falls on a tanner's fleshing knife and dies.
*   Wolfher Stercza, enraged, vows bloody vengeance on Reynevan and his entire family.
*   Reynevan flees Oleśnica, heading towards Wrocław.

**Chapter 2: The Aftermath and Widening Circles of Danger**
*   **Oleśnica Town Council:** Mayor Bartłomiej Sachs, merchant Jan Hofrichter, Father Jakub von Gall, and goldsmith Łukasz Frydman discuss the incident.
    *   They decide to blame the Sterczas for the public disturbance and Niklas's accidental death.
    *   They discuss Adela's accusation of witchcraft and the suspicious items (alembic, pentagram, books on medicine and herbs, including one by Thomas de Bohemia) found in Reynevan's workshop.
    *   Hofrichter wants to inform the Holy Office, but Father Gall and others, knowing Reynevan's influential lineage (great-grandson of Thomas Behem, a respected cleric and physician with Piast connections), advocate for protecting him and investigating quietly.
    *   They fear the intervention of the powerful Tammo Stercza.
    *   A mysterious wallcreeper (a bird with supernatural connotations) observes their meeting.
*   **Sterzendorf Castle:** Apeczko Stercza reports to the paralyzed and tyrannical patriarch, Tammo "Balbulus" von Stercza (who communicates through his child translator, Ofka).
    *   Tammo is furious about Niklas's death and dismissive of Wolfher's competence.
    *   He orders horrific revenge on Reynevan and plans to capture him.
    *   Tammo tasks Apeczko with hiring notorious mercenaries (Kunz "Kyrieleison" Aulock, etc.) for a large sum to bring Reynevan back alive.
    *   Apeczko resents Tammo but fears him, contemplating a simpler assassination of Reynevan.
    *   The wallcreeper is seen again as Apeczko's messenger departs.
*   **Sensenberg Castle:** A ruined and feared Templar fortress.
    *   A group of mysterious hooded knights gathers in a ritualistic meeting.
    *   The wallcreeper arrives and transforms into one of these knights.
    *   They identify Reinmar of Bielawa (Reynevan) as their next target.

**Chapter 3: An Unexpected Alliance**
*   Reynevan, wandering in the forests, encounters Duke Konrad Kantner of Oleśnica's hunting party.
*   His friends among Kantner's knights (Ciołek Krompusz, Benno Ebersbach) provide him with clothes and Ebersbach warns him about Niklas's death and Adela's witchcraft accusation, advising him to flee the Inquisition.
*   The party stops at the "Under the Gander" Inn, where they meet three clergymen: Maciej Korzbok, Melchior Barfuss, and Jan Nejedly (an exiled Prague Dominican).
*   Nejedly vehemently denounces Hussite atrocities.
*   A debate erupts when Duke Kantner's swarthy guest argues that Jan Hus should not have been burned in Constance, criticizing King Sigismund for breaking his promise of safe conduct.
*   The guest, clergymen, and Duke discuss the ethics of keeping promises to heretics, Polish King Jogajła's ambiguous stance on the Hussites, and the fear of Hussite expansion.
*   Outside the inn, Duke Kantner tells Reynevan he cannot take him to Wrocław (his brother, the Bishop, would imprison Reynevan for adultery).
*   Instead, Kantner instructs Reynevan to go to the Joannite commandery in Mała Oleśnica for "penance" and provides him with a horse and a small sum of money.
*   For safety, Reynevan is to travel with Kantner's guest.
*   Reynevan expresses concern about facing the Sterczas with only one knight for protection.
*   Kantner reveals his guest is the renowned knight, Zawisza Czarny of Garbów.
