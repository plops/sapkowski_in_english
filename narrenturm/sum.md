**Introduction/Blurb (Pre-Chapter 1)**
*   Introduces the novel "Narrenturm" (The Tower of Fools) by Andrzej Sapkowski.

**Prologue/Narrator's Introduction (Before Chapter 1, after the blurb)**

*   The narrator (speaking to an audience in an inn) comments on the general state of the world: wars, plagues, famine, and moral decay persist.
*   Lists prominent deaths and historical events of the early 1420s (Jan Kropidło, Henry V of England, Charles VI of France, Pope Benedict XIII, King Jogajła's marriage and campaign against Teutonic Knights).
*   Highlights cultural achievements of the time (preachers, writers, artists).
*   The narrator expresses caution about discussing Bohemian (Hussite) affairs due to the mixed and potentially dangerous company present (Poles, Czechs, different religious orders).
*   Briefly recounts key events in the Hussite Wars (Jogajła declining the Bohemian crown, Korybutowicz's involvement, Žižka's victories and death).
*   The narrator offers to tell a story about these "dreadful" but "historical" times, warning that its pleasant beginning is deceptive.

**Chapter 1: Reynevan's Tryst and Escape**
*   Reynevan is in bed with Adela von Stercza in an attic room in Oleśnica, near an Augustinian monastery, while monks sing Sext.
*   Details of their amorous encounter, with Reynevan's internal musings and quotes from the Song of Solomon.
*   Background on how Gelfrad von Stercza (Adela's husband) met Adela and how his absence (due to injury on a crusade) facilitated the affair.
*   The Stercza brothers (Wolfher, Wittich, Morold) violently interrupt the lovers.
*   Adela is beaten; Reynevan is attacked. Adela, under duress, accuses Reynevan of using sorcery on her.
*   Augustinian monks, including Prior Erazm Steinkeller and the formidable Brother Innocent, intervene, leading to a larger brawl.
*   Reynevan manages to escape on a horse, pursued by the Sterczas and their allies.
*   A chaotic chase ensues through the streets and market square of Oleśnica.
*   During the pursuit, the youngest Stercza brother, Niklas, accidentally falls on a tanner's fleshing knife and dies.
*   Wolfher Stercza, enraged, vows bloody vengeance on Reynevan and his entire family.
*   Reynevan flees Oleśnica, heading towards Wrocław.

**Chapter 2: The Aftermath and Widening Circles of Danger**
*   **Oleśnica Town Council:** Mayor Bartłomiej Sachs, merchant Jan Hofrichter, Father Jakub von Gall, and goldsmith Łukasz Frydman discuss the incident.
    *   They decide to blame the Sterczas for the public disturbance and Niklas's accidental death.
    *   They discuss Adela's accusation of witchcraft and the suspicious items (alembic, pentagram, books on medicine and herbs, including one by Thomas de Bohemia) found in Reynevan's workshop.
    *   Hofrichter wants to inform the Holy Office, but Father Gall and others, knowing Reynevan's influential lineage (great-grandson of Thomas Behem, a respected cleric and physician with Piast connections), advocate for protecting him and investigating quietly.
    *   They fear the intervention of the powerful Tammo Stercza.
    *   A mysterious wallcreeper (a bird with supernatural connotations) observes their meeting.
*   **Sterzendorf Castle:** Apeczko Stercza reports to the paralyzed and tyrannical patriarch, Tammo "Balbulus" von Stercza (who communicates through his child translator, Ofka).
    *   Tammo is furious about Niklas's death and dismissive of Wolfher's competence.
    *   He orders horrific revenge on Reynevan and plans to capture him.
    *   Tammo tasks Apeczko with hiring notorious mercenaries (Kunz "Kyrieleison" Aulock, etc.) for a large sum to bring Reynevan back alive.
    *   Apeczko resents Tammo but fears him, contemplating a simpler assassination of Reynevan.
    *   The wallcreeper is seen again as Apeczko's messenger departs.
*   **Sensenberg Castle:** A ruined and feared Templar fortress.
    *   A group of mysterious hooded knights gathers in a ritualistic meeting.
    *   The wallcreeper arrives and transforms into one of these knights.
    *   They identify Reinmar of Bielawa (Reynevan) as their next target.

**Chapter 3: An Unexpected Alliance**
*   Reynevan, wandering in the forests, encounters Duke Konrad Kantner of Oleśnica's hunting party.
*   His friends among Kantner's knights (Ciołek Krompusz, Benno Ebersbach) provide him with clothes and Ebersbach warns him about Niklas's death and Adela's witchcraft accusation, advising him to flee the Inquisition.
*   The party stops at the "Under the Gander" Inn, where they meet three clergymen: Maciej Korzbok, Melchior Barfuss, and Jan Nejedly (an exiled Prague Dominican).
*   Nejedly vehemently denounces Hussite atrocities.
*   A debate erupts when Duke Kantner's swarthy guest argues that Jan Hus should not have been burned in Constance, criticizing King Sigismund for breaking his promise of safe conduct.
*   The guest, clergymen, and Duke discuss the ethics of keeping promises to heretics, Polish King Jogajła's ambiguous stance on the Hussites, and the fear of Hussite expansion.
*   Outside the inn, Duke Kantner tells Reynevan he cannot take him to Wrocław (his brother, the Bishop, would imprison Reynevan for adultery).
*   Instead, Kantner instructs Reynevan to go to the Joannite commandery in Mała Oleśnica for "penance" and provides him with a horse and a small sum of money.
*   For safety, Reynevan is to travel with Kantner's guest.
*   Reynevan expresses concern about facing the Sterczas with only one knight for protection.
*   Kantner reveals his guest is the renowned knight, Zawisza Czarny of Garbów.


Okay, here is a bullet-list summary for each of the newly translated chapters:

**Chapter 4: Reynevan and Zawisza Czarny on the Road, and a Prophetic Encounter**
*   Reynevan and Zawisza Czarny ride together; Zawisza suffers from pronounced flatulence due to cabbage.
*   Zawisza discusses Grunwald, stating he doesn't recall individuals in battle, and admonishes Reynevan for adultery, comparing him to a common thief. Reynevan defends his love for Adela by referencing famous romances, but Zawisza is unimpressed.
*   Reynevan uses his herbal knowledge to successfully treat Zawisza's flatulence, earning the knight's respect.
*   They make camp. Reynevan elaborates on shepherd's herbal lore, including "other powers," prompting Zawisza to warn him about the dangers of appearing to practice magic, especially when invoking names like Gerbert of Aurillac.
*   Reynevan asks Zawisza about his capture at Německý Brod. Zawisza recounts his diplomatic mission for King Władysław, joining Sigismund's disastrous crusade against the Hussites, witnessing the crusader army's cowardice, and his own eventual capture after a brave fight.
*   A strange, cat-eared creature named Hans Mein Igel appears. Zawisza calmly invites him to the fire.
*   Zawisza explains that his honest report of the Hussite strength and crusader weakness to King Władysław Jagiełło convinced the Polish king not to send his knights on anti-Hussite crusades, saving them for conflicts with the Teutonic Order.
*   Hans Mein Igel delivers prophecies:
    *   For Reynevan: Love will determine his fate and save his life, as "the Goddess has many names and even more faces."
    *   For Zawisza: He warns him against going to "Gołębi Gród" (Golubac/Dove Castle) by a great river, calling it a bad place for him.
*   Zawisza, though wishing for a prophecy of love, accepts his warrior's fate and refuses to turn back. Hans Mein Igel vanishes.
*   Reynevan expresses admiration for Zawisza's composure. Zawisza remarks that some humans are more alien to him than the creature.
*   At a crossroads, inspired by Zawisza's resolve, Reynevan decides to return to Adela. They part ways, with Zawisza doubting they will meet again.

**Chapter 5: Flight, Unexpected Allies, and a River Escape**
*   Reynevan, lost in morning fog, realizes he has ridden in circles and is back at the same penitential cross. He uses a folk magic charm (*nawęzy*) to find the correct path.
*   He arrives at an inn, drawn by smells and possibly misled by his charm due to another hex present. He is ambushed by Kunz "Kyrieleison" Aulock and his mercenaries.
*   A serving girl, Gerda (who seems to recognize Reynevan's connection to folk magic via his charm and her own marsh marigold ring), warns him and aids his escape by creating a diversion (an exploding chimney) and using a magical knotted straw to trip his pursuers.
*   Reynevan flees, pursued by Kyrieleison. He is unexpectedly aided by a young, fair-haired noblewoman on a superior horse, who calls herself Nikoletta. She takes Reynevan's cloak to act as a decoy and directs him to the Stobrawa marshes, easily outdistancing the pursuers.
*   Reynevan reaches the marshes, but his horse goes lame. He hides as Kyrieleison's men search nearby.
*   He has a dream or vision of Gerda, who tells him: "What leaves no trace? A bird in the air, a fish in the water," suggesting escape via the river.
*   He reaches the Odra River and encounters "Wasserpolen" (Water Poles, Odra rivermen). After a brief language test (a shibboleth), he sells his lame horse for passage money.
*   He travels for a day and a half on their scow towards Oława, observing their lives, customs, and hardships.
*   The skipper drops him near Oława, on the way to the Strzelin road, allowing Reynevan to successfully evade his pursuers by taking to the water.
