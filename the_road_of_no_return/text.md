**THE ROAD OF NO RETURN**

**I**

The bird with mottled feathers, perched on Visenna’s shoulder, squawked, flapped its wings, then with a whir, it took to the air and soared into the thicket. Visenna reined in her horse, listened for a moment, then cautiously proceeded along the forest path.

The man seemed to be asleep. He sat leaning his back against a post at the center of the crossroads. From a closer distance, Visenna saw that his eyes were open. She had already noticed he was injured. A makeshift bandage covering his left shoulder and bicep was soaked with blood that had not yet turned black.

“Greetings, young man,” the wounded man spoke, spitting out a long blade of grass. “Where are you headed, if I may ask?”

Visenna didn’t like the “young man.” She threw back her hood.

“One may ask,” she replied, “but it would be proper to justify such curiosity.”

“Forgive me, milady,” the man said, squinting. “You wear men’s attire. As for curiosity, it is justified, indeed. This is an unusual crossroads. I had an interesting adventure here…”

“I see,” Visenna interrupted, looking at the motionless, unnaturally twisted shape, half-buried in the undergrowth no more than ten paces from the post.

The man followed her gaze. Then their eyes met. Visenna, pretending to brush hair from her forehead, touched the diadem hidden beneath a snakeskin band.

“Ah, yes,” the wounded man said calmly. “There lies the deceased. You have sharp eyes. You probably think me a robber? Am I right?”

“You are not,” Visenna said, not removing her hand from the diadem.

“Ah…” the man stammered. “Yes. Well…”

“Your wound is bleeding.”

“Most wounds have that strange property,” the wounded man smiled. He had nice teeth.

“Under a bandage applied with one hand, it will bleed for a long time.”

“Would you perhaps honor me with your help?”

Visenna dismounted, her heel digging into the soft earth.

“My name is Visenna,” she said. “I am not accustomed to honoring anyone. Besides, I can’t stand it when someone addresses me in the plural. I’ll tend to your wound. Can you stand?”

“I can. Must I?”

“No.”

“Visenna,” the man said, rising slightly to make it easier for her to unwrap the cloth. “A pretty name. Has anyone ever told you, Visenna, that you have beautiful hair? That color is called copper, isn’t it?”

“No. Red.”

“Aha. When you’re done, I’ll offer you a bouquet of lupines, those over there, growing in the ditch. And during the operation, I’ll tell you, just to kill time, what happened to me. I came, imagine, the same way you did. I see a post standing at the crossroads. Oh, this very one. A board is attached to the post. This hurts.”

“Most wounds have that strange property.” Visenna tore off the last layer of cloth, not trying to be gentle.

“True, I forgot. What was I… Ah, yes. I approach, I look, there’s writing on the board. Terribly crooked; I once knew an archer who could piss prettier letters in the snow. I read… And what’s this, my lady? What’s this stone? Oh, blast it. I didn’t expect this.”

Visenna slowly moved the hematite along the wound. The bleeding stopped instantly. Closing her eyes, she grasped the man’s arm with both hands, firmly pressing the edges of the cut together. She removed her hands – the tissue had knitted, leaving a welt and a scarlet stripe.

The man was silent, watching her intently. Finally, he carefully raised his arm, straightened it, rubbed the scar, and shook his head. He pulled on the bloodied shred of his shirt and jerkin, stood up, picked up his belt with a sword, pouch, and canteen, fastened with a buckle shaped like a dragon’s head.

“Yes, that’s what you call luck,” he said, not taking his eyes off Visenna. “I stumbled upon a healer in the middle of the wilderness, at the fork of the Ina and Jaruga, where it’s usually easier to find a werewolf or, worse, a drunken woodcutter. How about payment for the treatment? I’m currently short on cash. Will a bouquet of lupines suffice?”

Visenna ignored the question. She approached the post, tilted her head back – the board was nailed at the man’s eye level.

“‘You who come from the west,’” she read aloud. “‘Go left, you will return. Go right, you will return. Go straight, you will not return.’ Nonsense.”

“Exactly what I thought,” the man agreed, brushing pine needles off his trousers. “I know these parts. Straight ahead, that is to the east, leads to the Klamat Pass, to the merchant trail. Why shouldn’t one be able to return from there? Such pretty girls eager for marriage? Cheap vodka? A vacant mayor’s post?”

“You’re straying from the subject, Korin.”

The man’s mouth fell open, utterly astonished.

“How do you know my name is Korin?”

“You told me yourself a moment ago. Continue your story.”

“Did I?” The man looked at her suspiciously. “Really? Well, maybe… Where did I leave off? Aha. So I’m reading and wondering what kind of fool came up with this inscription. Suddenly, I hear someone muttering and mumbling behind me. I turn around, an old woman, all white-haired, hunched, with a little stick, of course. I ask politely what’s wrong with her. She mutters: ‘I’m hungry, noble knight, haven’t had a bite since dawn.’ I guess the old dear still has at least one tooth. I was moved beyond words, so I take a piece of bread from my sack and half a smoked bream I got from fishermen on the Jaruga, and I give it to the old woman. She sits down, munches, grunts, spits out bones. I’m still looking at this strange signpost. Suddenly, a granny speaks up: ‘You’re good, knight, you helped me, a reward will not miss you.’ I wanted to tell her where she could shove her reward, and the granny says: ‘Come closer, I have something to tell you in your ear, an important secret to reveal, how to save many good people from misfortune, gain fame and fortune.’”

Visenna sighed, sat down next to the wounded man. She liked him, tall, fair-haired, with a long face and a prominent chin. He didn’t stink like the men she usually met. She pushed away the intrusive thought that she had been wandering alone through forests and along high roads for too long. Korin continued his tale:

“Ha, I thought to myself,” he said, “a classic opportunity presents itself. If the granny doesn’t have dementia, and has all her wits about her, then maybe there’ll be some profit in this for a poor soldier. I bend down, lend an ear like a fool. And if it weren’t for my reflexes, I would have gotten it straight in the throat. I jumped back, blood spurting from my shoulder like from a palace fountain, and the granny comes at me with a knife, howling, snorting, and spitting. I still didn’t think it was a serious matter. I closed in to negate her advantage, and I feel she’s no old woman. Breasts hard as flints…”

Korin glanced towards Visenna to see if she was blushing. Visenna listened with a polite expression of curiosity on her face.

“What was I… Aha. I thought I’d knock her off her feet and disarm her, but no way. Strong as a lynx. I feel, in a moment her hand with the knife will slip out of my grasp. What was I to do? I pushed her away, grabbed my sword… She impaled herself.”

Visenna sat silently, her hand at her forehead, as if in thought, she adjusted the snakeskin band.

“Visenna? I’m telling it like it was. I know she’s a woman and I feel stupid, but may I die if she was a normal woman. Immediately after she fell, she changed. She grew younger.”

“An illusion,” Visenna said thoughtfully.

“What’s that?”

“Nothing.” Visenna stood up, walked over to the corpse lying in the ferns.

“Just look.” Korin stood beside her. “A woman like a statue in a palace fountain. And she was hunched and wrinkled like the rump of a hundred-year-old cow. Well, I’ll be…”

“Korin,” Visenna interrupted, “are your nerves strong?”

“Huh? What do my nerves have to do with it? Indeed, if you’re interested, I don’t complain.”

Visenna removed the band from her forehead. The jewel in the diadem glowed with a milky luminescence. She stood over the corpse, extended her hands, closed her eyes. Korin watched her with his mouth half-open. Visenna bowed her head, whispering something he didn’t understand.

“Grealghane!” she suddenly shouted.

The ferns rustled violently. Korin leaped back, drawing his sword, freezing in a defensive stance. The corpse twitched.

“Grealghane! Speak!”

“Aaaaaaaa!” a growing, hoarse shriek came from the ferns. The corpse arched like a bow, almost levitating, touching the ground with its back and the top of its head. The shriek subsided, began to break, turning into a guttural babble, broken moans and cries, gradually taking on a cadence, but absolutely incomprehensible. Korin felt a cold trickle of sweat down his back, irritating like a crawling caterpillar. Clenching his fists to stop the tingling in his forearms, with all his willpower he fought the overwhelming urge to flee into the depths of the forest.

“Oggg… nnnn… nngammm,” the corpse babbled, clawing the earth with its fingernails, gurgling bloody bubbles that burst on its lips. “Nam… eeeggg…”

“Speak!”

A murky stream of light, in which dust swirled and eddied, trickled from Visenna’s outstretched hands. Dry leaves and blades of grass flew upwards from the ferns. The corpse choked, smacked its lips, and suddenly spoke. Quite clearly.

“…crossroads six miles from Klucz at noon at the latest. Poo… He sent. Of the Circle. The boy. To che… ggg… Orrrdered. Ordered.”

“Who?!” Visenna shouted. “Who ordered? Speak!”

“Fffff… ggg… genal. All the writings, letters, amulets. Rin… ngs.”

“Speak!”

“…pass. Kościej. Ge… nal. Take the letters. Par… chments. He will come with maaaaaaaaa! Eeeeeeeee! Nyyyyyyyyy!!!”

The babbling voice vibrated, dissolved into a terrifying shriek. Korin couldn’t stand it; he dropped his sword, closed his eyes, and pressed his hands to his ears. He stood like that until he felt a touch on his shoulder. He flinched violently, his whole body, as if someone had grabbed him by the genitals.

“It’s all over,” Visenna said, wiping sweat from her forehead. “I asked about your nerves.”

“What a day,” Korin groaned. He picked up his sword, sheathed it, trying not to look towards the now motionless body.

“Visenna?”

“Yes?”

“Let’s get out of here. As far away from this place as possible.”

**II**

They rode together on Visenna’s horse along a forest track, overgrown and bumpy. She in front, in the saddle, Korin bareback behind her, his arms around her waist. Visenna had long since grown accustomed to uninhibitedly enjoying the small pleasures occasionally offered by fate, so she leaned her back against the man’s chest with satisfaction. They were both silent.

“Visenna,” Korin was the first to speak, after nearly an hour.

“Yes.”

“You’re not just a healer. Are you from the Circle?”

“Yes.”

“Judging by that… display, a master?”

“Yes.”

Korin released her waist and held onto the pommel of the saddle. Visenna narrowed her eyes in anger. Of course, he hadn’t noticed.

“Visenna?”

“Yes?”

“Did you understand anything of what that… what it… was saying?”

“Not much.”

They fell silent again. The mottled bird, flying above them among the leaves, squawked loudly.

“Visenna?”

“Korin, do me a favor.”

“Huh?”

“Stop talking. I want to think.”

The track led them straight down into a ravine, into the bed of a shallow stream, lazily winding among boulders and black tree trunks, in the pervasive scent of mint and nettle. The horse slipped on stones covered with a sediment of clay and mud. Korin, to avoid falling, grasped Visenna’s waist again. He pushed away the intrusive thought that he had been wandering alone through forests and along high roads for too long.

**III**

The settlement was a typical ribbon development, clinging to the mountainside, strung out along the track, thatched, wooden, and dirty, huddled among crooked fences. When they rode up, the dogs raised a clamor. Visenna’s horse ambled calmly down the middle of the road, paying no attention to the fierce mongrels stretching their foaming muzzles towards its fetlocks.

At first, they saw no one. Then, from behind the fences, from the paths leading to the threshing floors, the inhabitants appeared – they approached slowly, barefoot and sullen. They carried pitchforks, poles, flails. One bent down, picked up a stone.

Visenna reined in her horse, raised her hand. Korin noticed she held a small golden knife shaped like a sickle in her hand.

“I am a healer,” she said clearly and sonorously, though not loudly at all.

The peasants lowered their weapons, murmured, looked at each other. There were more and more of them. A few of the closer ones took off their caps.

“What is this village called?”

“Klucz,” came from the crowd after a moment of silence.

“Who is your elder?”

“Topin, noble lady. That hut over there.”

Before they moved, a woman with an infant in her arms squeezed through the line of farmers.

“Lady…” she moaned, timidly touching Visenna’s knee. “My daughter… She’s burning with fever…”

Visenna dismounted, touched the child’s head, closed her eyes.

“She will be healthy tomorrow. Don’t wrap her so warmly.”

“Thank you, noble lady… A thousand thanks…”

Topin, the village elder, was already in the yard, wondering what to do with the pitchfork he held at the ready. Finally, he used it to sweep chicken droppings off the steps.

“Forgive me,” he said, leaning the pitchfork against the wall of the hut. “Lady. And you, noble sir. These are uncertain times… Please, come inside. I invite you for some refreshment.”

They entered.

Topin’s wife, towing two straw-haired girls clinging to her skirt, served scrambled eggs, bread, and soured milk, then disappeared into the pantry. Visenna, unlike Korin, ate little, sat sullen and quiet. Topin rolled his eyes, scratched himself in various places, and talked.

“Uncertain times. Uncertain. We are poor, nobles. We raise sheep for wool, for sale, this wool, but now there are no merchants, so we slaughter the flocks, we slaughter woolly sheep, to put something in the pot. In the old days, merchants came for jasper, for green stone to Amell, through the pass, there are mines there. They extract jasper there. And when the merchants came, they also took wool, paid, left various goods. Now there are no merchants. We don’t even have salt; what we slaughter, we must eat in three days.”

“Caravans bypass you? Why?” Visenna, lost in thought, occasionally touched the band on her forehead.

“They do bypass us,” Topin grumbled. “The road to Amell is closed, a cursed kościej has settled in the pass, won’t let a living soul through. So how can merchants go there? To their deaths?”

Korin froze with his spoon suspended in mid-air.

“Kościej? What is a kościej?”

“How should I know? A kościej, they say, a man-eater. Supposedly sits in the pass.”

“And doesn’t let caravans through?”

Topin looked around the room.

“Only some. His own, they say. He lets his own through.”

Visenna frowned.

“What do you mean… his own?”

“Well, his own,” Topin mumbled and turned pale. “The people of Amell are even worse off than us. At least the forest provides us with something. But they sit on bare rock and only have what they sell to the kościej’s men for jasper. Cruelly, like robbers, they say, they charge for every good, but what can those from Amell do? They won’t eat jasper.”

“‘Kościej’s men’? People?”

“People and vrany, and others. They are ruffians, lady. They transport to Amell what they take from us, there they exchange it for jasper and green stone. And they take from us by force. In the villages, it happened, they plundered, raped girls, and if anyone resisted, they murdered, set people’s homes on fire. Ruffians. Kościej’s men.”

“How many of them?” Korin spoke up.

“Who would count them, noble sir. The villages defend themselves, stick together. What good is it, when they attack at night, set fires. It’s better sometimes to give what they want. Because they say…”

Topin turned even paler, trembled all over.

“What do they say, Topin?”

“They say that the kościej, if angered, will come out of the pass and head towards us, towards the valleys.”

Visenna stood up abruptly, her face changed. A shiver ran down Korin’s spine.

“Topin,” the sorceress said. “Where is the nearest smithy here? My horse lost a shoe on the track.”

“Further past the village, by the forest. There’s a smithy and a stable there.”

“Good. Now go, ask around, see who is sick or injured.”

“May you be thanked, noble benefactress.”

“Visenna,” Korin spoke as soon as the door closed behind Topin. The druidess turned, looked at him.

“Your horse has all its shoes in order.”

Visenna remained silent.

“Jasper is obviously jasper, and green stone is jadeite, for which the mines in Amell are famous,” Korin continued. “And Amell can only be reached through Klamat, through the pass. The road of no return. What did the deceased at the crossroads say? Why did she want to kill me?”

Visenna did not answer.

“You say nothing? Never mind. Everything is starting to become beautifully clear anyway. The old woman at the crossroads was waiting for someone who would stop before the stupid sign forbidding further travel east. That was the first test: can the newcomer read. Then the granny makes sure: who, if not a good Samaritan from the Circle of Druids, would help a hungry old woman in these times? Anyone else, I’ll bet my head, would have taken her stick too. The cunning granny investigates further, starts babbling about poor people in misfortune, needing help. The traveler, instead of treating her to a kick and a foul word, as an ordinary, common inhabitant of these parts would do, listens intently. Yes, thinks the granny, it’s him. A Druid going to deal with the gang persecuting the area. And since she herself is undoubtedly sent by that gang, she reaches for a knife. Ha! Visenna! Am I not exceptionally intelligent?”

Visenna did not answer. She stood with her head turned towards the window. She could see – the translucent membranes of fish bladders were no obstacle to her sight – the mottled bird sitting on a cherry tree.

“Visenna?”

“Yes.”

“What is a kościej?”

“Korin,” Visenna said sharply, turning towards him. “Why are you meddling in affairs that aren’t yours?”

“Listen,” Korin was not in the least bothered by her tone. “I’m already mixed up in your, as you say, affairs. It so happened they wanted to slaughter me instead of you.”

“Accidentally.”

“I thought sorcerers didn’t believe in accidents, only in magical attraction, a confluence of events, and such things. Notice, we’re riding one horse. A fact and a metaphor at the same time. In short… I offer you my help in a mission whose purpose I can guess. I will treat refusal as a sign of arrogance. I’ve been told that you, from the Circle, greatly disregard ordinary mortals.”

“That’s a lie.”

“That’s excellent,” Korin bared his teeth. “Then let’s not waste time. Let’s go to the smithy.”

**IV**

Mikula gripped the rod more firmly with his tongs and turned it in the embers.

“Pump, Czop!” he ordered.

The apprentice hung on the bellows lever. His chubby face shone with sweat. Despite the wide-open doors, it was unbearably hot in the smithy. Mikula transferred the rod to the anvil, flattening the end with a few strong hammer blows.

The wheelwright Radim, sitting on an unworked birch stump, was also sweating. He unbuttoned his coat and pulled his shirt out of his trousers.

“Easy for you to say, Mikula,” he said. “Fighting is nothing new to you. Everyone knows you haven’t spent your whole life forging in a smithy. They say you used to bash heads, not iron.”

“Then you should be glad to have such a man in your company,” said the blacksmith. “For the second time, I tell you, I will no longer bow to those scoundrels. Nor work for them. If you don’t go with me, I’ll start alone or with those who have blood, not small beer, in their veins. We’ll take to the forests, we’ll thrash them one by one, whenever I catch one. How many of them? Thirty? Maybe not even that. And how many villages on this side of the pass? Strong peasants? Pump, Czop!”

“I am pumping!”

“Harder!”

The hammer rang against the anvil rhythmically, almost melodically. Czop pumped the bellows. Radim blew his nose into his fingers, wiped his hand on his boot-leg.

“Easy for you to say,” he repeated. “And how many from Klucz will go?”

The blacksmith lowered his hammer, remained silent.

“That’s what I thought,” said the wheelwright. “No one will go.”

“Klucz is a small village. You were supposed to find out in Poróg and Kaczan.”

“And so I did. I told you how it is. Without soldiers from Mayena, people won’t move. Some say: what are those, vrany, bobołaks, we can take them on our pitchforks in three winks, but what to do when the kościej comes for us? Flee into the forest. And the huts, the property? We can’t carry it on our backs. And we’re no match for the kościej, you know that.”

“How should I know?! Has anyone seen him?!” shouted the blacksmith. “Maybe there’s no kościej at all? They just want to scare the shit out of you peasants? Has anyone seen him?”

“Don’t say that, Mikula,” Radim bowed his head. “You yourself know that the merchants’ guards were no ordinary brawlers, hung with iron, real cutthroats. And did any of them return from the pass? Not one. No, Mikula. We must wait, I tell you. If the Count of Mayena gives aid, then it will be a different matter.”

Mikula put down the hammer, placed the rod back in the forge.

“The army from Mayena won’t come,” he said grimly. “The lords have fallen out amongst themselves. Mayena with Razwan.”

“Over what?”

“How can you understand what and why nobles fight?! In my opinion, out of boredom, those rotten fools!” yelled the blacksmith. “You’ve seen him, the Count! What do we pay tribute to him for, the reptile?”

He snatched the rod from the embers, sparks flying, and whirled it in the air. Czop jumped back. Mikula grabbed the hammer, struck once, twice, thrice.

“When the Count drove my boy out, I sent him to their Circle there, to ask for help. To the druids.”

“To sorcerers?” the wheelwright asked incredulously. “Mikula?”

“To them. But the boy hasn’t returned yet.”

Radim shook his head, stood up, pulled up his trousers.

“I don’t know, Mikula, I don’t know. It’s not for my head to decide. But it all comes down to the same thing. We have to wait. Finish your work, they’re coming together, I need to…”

A horse neighed in the yard in front of the smithy.

The blacksmith froze with his hammer raised above the anvil. The wheelwright’s teeth chattered, he turned pale. Mikula noticed his hands were trembling; he unconsciously wiped them on his leather apron. It didn’t help. He swallowed and moved towards the entrance, where the silhouettes of riders were clearly outlined. Radim and Czop followed him, very close, from behind. As he went out, the blacksmith leaned the rod against the post by the door.

He saw six, all on horseback, in gambesons studded with iron plates, chainmail, leather helmets with steel nasals that formed a straight line of metal between enormous ruby-red eyes occupying half their faces. They sat on their horses motionless, as if casually. Mikula, his gaze darting from one to another, saw their weapons – short spears with broad blades. Swords with strangely forged guards. Bardiches. Serrated guisarmes.

Two stood directly in front of the smithy entrance. A tall vran on a grey horse covered with a green caparison, with a sun emblem on his helmet. And the other…

“Mother Mary,” Czop whispered behind the blacksmith’s back. And sobbed.

The second rider was human. He wore a dark green vran cloak, but from under the beaked helmet, pale blue – not red – eyes looked at them. In those eyes lay so much cold, indifferent cruelty that Mikula was pierced by a monstrous fear that crept coldly into his bowels, sickening, flowing with a tingle to his buttocks. It was still quiet. The blacksmith heard the buzzing of flies swarming over a dung heap behind the fence.

The man in the beaked helmet spoke first.

“Which of you is the blacksmith?”

The question was pointless; Mikula’s leather apron and build gave him away at first glance. The blacksmith remained silent. He caught a brief gesture the pale-eyed man made to one of the vrany. The vran leaned in his saddle and swung his guisarme, held halfway up the shaft, in a backhand motion. Mikula flinched, instinctively ducking his head into his shoulders. The blow, however, was not meant for him. The blade struck Czop in the neck and cut diagonally, deep, shattering his clavicle and vertebrae. The boy fell back against the smithy wall, staggered against the post by the door, and collapsed to the ground right in the entrance.

“I asked,” the man in the beaked helmet reminded him, not taking his eyes off Mikula. With his gloved hand, he touched the axe hanging from his saddle. Two vrany, standing furthest away, struck fire, lit resinous torches, and distributed them to others. Calmly, without haste, at a walk, they circled the smithy, applying the brands to the thatch.

Radim couldn’t take it. He covered his face with his hands, sobbed, and walked straight ahead, between two horses. When he drew level with the tall vran, the vran thrust his spear into his stomach with a powerful motion. The wheelwright howled, fell, twice bent and straightened his legs. He became still.

“Well now, Mikula, or whatever your name is,” said the pale-eyed man. “You’re left alone. And what good did it do you? Inciting people to rebel, sending for help somewhere? Did you think we wouldn’t find out? You’re stupid. There are those in the villages who will inform, just to curry favor.”

The thatch on the smithy crackled, groaned, billowed with dirty yellowish smoke, finally roared, bellowed with flames, showered sparks, hiccuped with a powerful breath of heat.

“We caught your apprentice; he sang about where you sent him. We’re also waiting for the one who’s supposed to come from Mayena,” continued the man in the beaked helmet. “Yes, Mikula. You stuck your filthy nose where it didn’t belong. For that, you’re about to experience serious unpleasantness. I think it would be worthwhile to impale you. Is there a decent stake to be found here in the yard? Or even better: we’ll hang you by your feet on the barn door and flay you like an eel.”

“Alright, enough talk,” said the tall vran with the sun on his helmet, tossing his brand into the open door of the smithy. “The whole village will be here soon. Let’s finish him off quickly, take the horses from the stable, and leave. Where does this love of torturing, of inflicting pain, come from in you humans? Unnecessary pain, at that? Go on, finish him.”

The pale-eyed man did not turn his head towards the vran. He leaned forward in his saddle, pressed his horse against the blacksmith.

“Get in,” he said. A murderer’s joy flickered in his pale eyes. “Inside. I don’t have time to prepare you properly. But I can at least roast you.”

Mikula took a step back. He felt the heat of the burning smithy on his back, roaring with beams falling from the ceiling. Another step. He stumbled over Czop’s body and the rod the boy had knocked over as he fell. The rod.

The blacksmith bent down instantly, grabbed the heavy iron, and without straightening, from below, with all the strength his hatred unleashed in him, he thrust the rod straight into the pale-eyed man’s chest. The chisel-forged point pierced the chainmail. Mikula didn’t wait for the man to fall from his horse. He lunged forward, diagonally across the yard. Behind him, a shriek, a thud of hooves. He reached the woodshed, dug his fingers into a stanchion leaning against the wall, immediately, with a half-turn, blindly, he struck. The blow landed squarely on the muzzle of the grey horse in the green caparison. The horse reared, throwing the vran with the sun on his helmet into the dust of the yard. Mikula ducked; a short spear thudded into the woodshed wall, quivered. The second vran, drawing his sword, spurred his horse, evading the whistling swing of the stanchion. The next three charged, screaming, brandishing their weapons. Mikula grunted, surrounding himself with a terrible windmill of the heavy pole. He hit something, again a horse, which neighed and danced on its hind legs. The vran stayed in the saddle.

Over the fence, from the forest side, a horse leaped, stretched out in its jump, colliding with the grey in the green caparison. The grey shied, tugged at the reins, knocking over the tall vran who was trying to mount it. Mikula, disbelieving his own eyes, saw that the new rider was splitting in two – into a hunched figure in a hood, leaning over the horse’s neck, and a fair-haired man with a sword, sitting behind.

The long, narrow sword blade described two semicircles, two flashes of lightning. Two vrany were swept from their saddles, crashing to the ground in clouds of dust. The third, driven all the way to the woodshed, turned towards the strange pair and received a thrust under the chin, just above his steel breastplate. The sword blade gleamed, momentarily visible from the back of his neck. The fair-haired man slid off the horse and ran across the yard, cutting off the tall vran from his mount. The vran drew his sword.

The fifth vran circled in the middle of the yard, trying to control his dancing horse, which was shying away from the burning smithy. With a raised bardiche, he looked around, hesitated. Finally, he screamed, struck his horse with his spurs, and charged at the hunched figure clinging to the horse’s mane. Mikula saw the small figure throw back its hood and rip a band from its forehead; he realized how mistaken he had been. The girl shook her red mane of hair and shouted incomprehensibly, extending her hand towards the charging vran. A thin stream of light, bright as mercury, shot from her fingers. The vran flew out of his saddle, described an arc in the air, and crashed onto the sand. His clothes were smoking. The horse, striking the ground with all four hooves, neighed, shook its head.

The tall vran with the sun on his helmet retreated slowly before the fair-haired man towards the burning smithy, hunched, both hands – the right holding a sword – extended before him. The fair-haired man leaped forward; they clashed once, twice. The vran’s sword flew to the side, and he himself, headfirst, hung on the blade piercing him. The fair-haired man stepped back, tugged, pulled out the sword blade. The vran fell to his knees, tilted, buried his face in the ground.

The rider unseated by the red-haired girl’s lightning rose to all fours, groping around for a weapon. Mikula shook off his surprise, took two steps, raised the stanchion, and brought it down on the fallen man’s neck. A bone crunched.

“Unnecessary,” he heard right beside him.

The girl in men’s attire was freckled and green-eyed. A strange jewel shone on her forehead.

“Unnecessary,” she repeated.

“Noble lady,” the blacksmith stammered, holding his pole like a guardsman’s halberd. “The smithy… They burned it. Killed the boy, hacked him down. And Radim. Hacked down, the bandits. Lady…”

The fair-haired man turned the tall vran’s body over with his foot, examined it, then approached, sheathing his sword.

“Well, Visenna,” he said. “Now I’m well and truly mixed up in this. The only thing that worries me is whether I’ve cut down the right ones.”

“Are you the blacksmith Mikula?” Visenna asked, tilting her head up.

“I am. And are you from the Druid Circle, nobles? From Mayena?”

Visenna did not answer. She was looking at the edge of the forest, at a group of people approaching at a run.

“They’re our own,” said the blacksmith. “From Klucz.”

**V**

“We got three of them!” thundered the black-bearded leader of the group from Poróg, shaking a scythe mounted upright. “Three, Mikula! They came after the girls in the fields and there we… One barely managed to escape, got to his horse, the son of a bitch!”

His men, crowded in the clearing within the circle of bonfires dotting the black night sky with specks of flying sparks, yelled, hooted, and brandished their weapons. Mikula raised his hands, quieting them, wanting to hear further reports.

“Four of them galloped up to us yesterday evening,” said the old, thin-as-a-rake elder from Kaczan. “After me. Someone must have informed them I was conspiring with you, blacksmith. I managed to get to the loft in the barn, pulled up the ladder, pitchfork in hand, come on, I shout, you dog-blooded curs, come on, which one, I shout. They started to burn the barn, it would have been over for me, but the people couldn’t hold back, they went at them as a group. Those ones on horses, broke through. A few of ours fell, but we swept one from his saddle.”

“Alive?” asked Mikula. “I sent word to take one alive.”

“Ehhh,” the lanky man snorted. “We didn’t make it. The women got boiling water, rushed in first…”

“I always said the women in Kaczan are hot-blooded,” the blacksmith muttered, scratching his neck. “And the one who informed?”

“We found him,” the thin man said briefly, without going into details.

“Good. And now listen, company. We already know where those scoundrels are hiding. At the foot of the mountain, next to the shepherds’ huts, there are caves in the rock. The bandits have holed up there and there we’ll get them. We’ll take hay, brushwood on wagons, smoke them out like badgers. We’ll block the road with a barricade, they won’t escape. That’s what I’ve arranged with this knight here, who calls himself Korin. And I, as you know, am no stranger to warfare. I went with Voivode Grozim against the vrany during the war, before I settled in Klucz.”

Battle cries rose from the crowd again, but quickly died down, stifled by words, at first spoken quietly, uncertainly. Then louder and louder. Finally, silence fell.

Visenna emerged from behind Mikula’s back, stood beside the blacksmith. She didn’t even reach his shoulder. The crowd murmured. Mikula raised both hands again.

“The time has come,” he called out, “that there’s no longer any need to keep it secret that I sent for help to the druids of the Circle, when the Count of Mayena refused us aid. It’s no news to me that many of you look askance at this.”

The crowd slowly quieted, but still swayed, rumbled.

“This is Lady Visenna,” Mikula said slowly. “From the Mayena Circle. She rushed to our aid at the first call. Those from Klucz already know her, she treated people there, healed them with her power. Yes, men. The lady is small, but her power is great. That power is beyond our understanding and frightens us, but surely it will serve to help us!”

Visenna did not utter a word, neither spoke nor made any gesture towards the assembled. But the hidden power of this small, freckled sorceress was incredible. Korin, with amazement, felt a strange enthusiasm permeate him, felt the fear of that something lurking in the pass, the fear of the unknown, disappear, dissipate, cease to exist, become unimportant, as long as the luminous jewel on Visenna’s forehead shone.

“So you see,” Mikula continued, “that even for that kościej a way will be found. We do not go alone, not unarmed. But first, we must exterminate those bandits!”

“Mikula’s right!” yelled the bearded man from Poróg. “What do we care, spells or no spells! To the pass, men! Death to the kościej’s lackeys!”

The crowd roared with one voice, the flames of the bonfires flashed on the blades of raised scythes, pikes, axes, and pitchforks.

Korin pushed through the crowd, retreated to the edge of the forest, found the cauldron hanging over a fire, a bowl, and a spoon. He scraped the last remnants of burnt porridge with cracklings from the bottom of the cauldron. He sat down, rested the bowl on his knees, ate slowly, spitting out barley husks. After a moment, he sensed someone’s presence.

“Sit down, Visenna,” he said with his mouth full.

He continued eating, glancing at her profile, half-hidden by a cascade of hair red as blood in the firelight. Visenna was silent, gazing at the flames.

“Hey, Visenna, why are we sitting like two owls?” Korin put down the bowl. “I can’t stand this, I get sad and cold right away. Where did they hide that moonshine? There was a jug here just a moment ago, damn it. Dark as a…”

The druidess turned to him. Her eyes glowed with a strange greenish light. Korin fell silent.

“Yes. That’s right,” he said after a moment and cleared his throat. “I am a thief. A mercenary. A robber. I got involved because I like fights, I don’t care who I fight with. I know the price of jasper, jadeite, and other stones still found in the Amell mines. I want to get rich. I don’t care how many of these people die tomorrow. What else do you want to know? I’ll tell you myself, you don’t need to use that trinket hidden under the snakeskin. I don’t intend to hide anything. You’re right, I don’t fit in with you, nor with your noble mission. That’s all. Goodnight. I’m going to sleep.”

Despite his words, he did not get up. He just grabbed a stick and poked the burning embers with it several times.

“Korin,” Visenna said quietly.

“Yes?”

“Don’t go.”

Korin lowered his head. Bluish geysers of flame erupted from a birch log in the fire. He looked at her, but couldn’t bear the sight of her unnervingly shining eyes. He turned his head towards the fire.

“Don’t demand too much of yourself,” Visenna said, wrapping herself in her cloak. “It’s just the way it is, that which is unnatural inspires fear. And disgust.”

“Visenna…”

“Don’t interrupt me. Yes, Korin, people need our help, they are grateful for it, often even sincerely, but they loathe us, fear us, don’t look us in the eye, spit behind our backs. The smarter ones, like you, are less sincere. You are no exception, Korin. I’ve heard from many already that they are not worthy enough to sit with me by the same fire. And it happens that we need the help of these… normal ones. Or their company.”

Korin remained silent.

“I know,” Visenna continued, “that it would be easier for you if I had a grey beard down to my waist and a hooked nose. Then disgust for my person wouldn’t cause such confusion in your head. Yes, Korin, disgust. This trinket I wear on my forehead is chalcedony… I owe a great deal of my magical abilities to it. You’re right, with the help of chalcedony I can read clearer thoughts. Yours are all too clear. Don’t expect me to be pleased about it. I am a sorceress, a witch, but besides that, a woman. I came here because I wanted to sleep with you.”

“Visenna…”

“No. Not anymore.”

They sat in silence. The mottled bird deep in the forest, in the darkness on a tree branch, felt fear. There were owls in the forest.

“About that disgust,” Korin finally spoke, “you exaggerated a bit. I admit, however, that you arouse something like… unease in me. You shouldn’t have let me see that, back at the crossroads. That corpse, you know?”

“Korin,” the sorceress said calmly. “When you thrust your sword into the vran’s throat by the smithy, I almost vomited onto my horse’s mane. I had trouble staying in the saddle. But let’s leave our specialties alone. Let’s end this conversation that’s leading nowhere.”

“Let’s end it, Visenna.”

The sorceress wrapped her cloak more tightly around herself. Korin added a few pieces of wood to the fire.

“Korin?”

“Yes?”

“I’d like it to stop being indifferent to you how many people die tomorrow. People and… And others. I’m counting on your help.”

“I’ll help you.”

“That’s not all. There’s the matter of the pass. I have to open the road through Klamat.”

Korin pointed with the glowing end of a stick to other fires and the people lying by them, asleep or engrossed in quiet conversations.

“With our magnificent army,” he said, “we shouldn’t have any trouble with that.”

“Our army will flee to their homes the moment I stop bewitching them with spells,” Visenna smiled sadly. “And I won’t bewitch them. I don’t want any of them to die fighting for a cause that isn’t theirs. And the kościej is not their business, it’s the Circle’s business. I have to go to the pass alone.”

“No. You won’t go alone,” Korin said. “We’ll go there together. I, Visenna, have known since childhood when to run and when it’s still too early. I’ve perfected this knowledge through years of practice, and thanks to that, I’m now considered brave. I have no intention of jeopardizing my reputation. You don’t need to bewitch me with spells. First, we’ll see what this kościej looks like. By the way, in your opinion, what is this kościej?”

Visenna bowed her head.

“I fear,” she whispered, “that it is death.”

**VI**

The others did not let themselves be surprised in the caves. They waited in their saddles, motionless, upright, staring at the ranks of armed peasants emerging from the forest. The wind tugging at their cloaks made them resemble emaciated birds of prey with tattered feathers, menacing, inspiring respect and fear.

“Eighteen,” Korin counted, standing in his stirrups. “All on horseback. Six spare horses. One wagon. Mikula!”

The blacksmith quickly reformed his unit. Those armed with pikes and javelins knelt at the edge of the thicket, driving the butts of their weapons into the ground. The archers chose positions behind trees. The rest retreated into the dense undergrowth.

One of the riders moved towards them, approached. He reined in his horse, raised his hand above his head, shouted something.

“A trick,” Mikula muttered. “I know them, sons of bitches.”

“We’ll see,” Korin said, dismounting. “Come.”

They slowly approached the horseman, the two of them. After a moment, Korin noticed Visenna following them.

The rider was a bobołak.

“I’ll be brief,” he called out, not dismounting. His small, shiny eyes flickered, half-hidden in the fur covering his face. “I am the current commander of the group you see there. Nine bobołaks, five humans, three vrany, one elf. The rest are dead. There have been disagreements among us. Our former leader, whose ideas brought us here, is in the cave, tied up. You can do with him as you wish. We want to leave.”

“Indeed, the speech was brief,” Mikula snorted. “You want to leave. And we want to gut you. What do you say to that?”

The bobołak flashed his pointed teeth, straightening his tiny figure in the saddle.

“Do you think I’m parleying out of fear of you, of your band of shit-stained peasants in straw shoes? By all means, if you wish, we’ll ride over your bellies. It’s our trade, peasant. I know what we’re risking. Even if some fall, the rest will get through. Such is life.”

“The wagon won’t get through,” Korin drawled. “Such is life.”

“We’ve factored that in.”

“What’s on the wagon?”

The bobołak spat over his right shoulder.

“One-twentieth of what’s left in the cave. And let’s be clear: if you tell us to leave the wagon, there’s no agreement. If we’re to come out of this mess without profit, we’d rather do so knowing it wasn’t without a fight. Well, what will it be? If we’re to fight, I’d prefer now, in the morning, before the sun starts to bake.”

“You’re bold,” said Mikula.

“Everyone in my family is.”

“We’ll let you go if you lay down your arms.”

The bobołak spat again, for a change, over his left shoulder.

“No way,” he snarled briefly.

“That’s where it hurts you,” Korin laughed. “Without weapons, you’re trash.”

“And what are you without weapons?” the dwarf asked without emotion. “A prince? I can see what you are. Do you think I’m blind?”

“With weapons, you’re ready to return tomorrow,” Mikula said slowly. “Even for the rest of what’s left in the cave, as you say. For even greater profit.”

The bobołak bared his teeth.

“There was such a concept. But we abandoned it after a short discussion.”

“Very wise,” Visenna suddenly said, stepping in front of Korin, standing right before the horseman. “Very wise that you abandoned it, Kehl.”

It seemed to Korin that the wind had suddenly intensified, howled among the rocks and grasses, struck with cold. Visenna continued speaking in an unnatural, metallic voice:

“Every one of you who tries to return here will die. I see it and I foretell it. Leave this place immediately. Immediately. Right now. Anyone who tries to return will die.”

The bobołak leaned down, looked at the sorceress over the horse’s neck. He was not young – his fur was already almost ash-grey, speckled with white tufts.

“Is it you? I thought so. I’m glad that… Never mind. I said I don’t intend to return here. We joined Fregenal for profit. That’s over. Now we have the Circle and entire villages on our backs, and Fregenal started babbling about ruling the world. We’ve had enough of him, and of that scarecrow from the pass.”

He jerked the reins, turned his horse.

“Why am I saying this? We’re leaving. Fare you well.”

No one answered him. The bobołak hesitated, looked at the edge of the forest, then looked back at the motionless line of his riders. He leaned forward in the saddle again and looked into Visenna’s eyes.

“I was against the attempt on your life,” he said. “Now I see I was right. If I tell you the kościej is death, you’ll still go to the pass, won’t you?”

“True.”

Kehl straightened up, shouted at his horse, galloped to his men. After a moment, the horsemen, forming a column, surrounding the wagon, moved towards the road. Mikula was already with his men, perorating, calming the bearded man from Poróg and others, hungry for blood and revenge. Korin and Visenna silently watched the departing unit pass them. They rode slowly, looking straight ahead, demonstrating calm and cold contempt. Only Kehl, as he passed them, slightly raised his hand in a farewell gesture, with a strange grimace on his face as he looked at Visenna. Then he abruptly spurred his horse, galloped to the head of the column, and disappeared among the trees.

**VII**

The first corpse lay at the very entrance to the caves, crushed, wedged between sacks of oats and a pile of brushwood. The corridor forked; just beyond the fork lay two more – one almost completely decapitated by a mace or club, the other covered in clotted blood from numerous wounds. All were human.

Visenna removed the band from her forehead. A light brighter than a torchbeam emanated from the diadem, illuminating the dark interior of the cave. The corridor led them to a larger cavern. Korin whistled softly through his teeth. Crates, sacks, and barrels stood against the walls; piles of horse tack, bales of wool, weapons, and tools were heaped up. Several crates were broken and empty. Others were full. Passing by, Korin saw dull green lumps of jasper, dark fragments of jadeite, agates, opals, chrysoprases, and other stones he didn’t know. On the stone floor, sparkling here and there with scattered specks of gold, silver, and copper coins, lay bundles of furs – beaver, lynx, fox, wolverine – tossed about haphazardly.

Visenna, without even pausing for a moment, headed towards a further cavern, much smaller, darker. Korin followed her.

“I am here,” spoke a dark, indistinct shape, lying on a pile of rags and skins covering the ground.

They approached. The bound man was short, bald, obese. A huge bruise covered half his face.

Visenna touched her diadem; the chalcedony flared with a brighter light for a second.

“That’s unnecessary,” said the bound man. “I know you. I’ve forgotten what they called you. I know what you have on your forehead. It’s unnecessary, I say. They attacked me in my sleep, took my ring, destroyed my wand. I am powerless.”

“Fregenal,” Visenna said. “You’ve changed.”

“Visenna,” the fat man muttered. “I remember now. I thought it would be a man, that’s why I sent Manissa. My Manissa would have dealt with a man.”

“She didn’t manage,” Korin boasted, looking around. “Although one must give the deceased her due. She tried her best.”

“A pity.”

Visenna looked around the cave, confidently walked to a corner, turned over a stone with the tip of her shoe, and from the hollow beneath it, she retrieved a clay pot tied with greased leather. She cut the thong with her golden sickle, pulled out a scroll of parchment. Fregenal watched her menacingly.

“Well, well,” he said, his voice trembling with anger. “What talent, congratulations. We know how to find hidden things. What else do we know? Divining from sheep’s entrails? Curing bloat in heifers?”

Visenna scanned page after page, paying him no attention.

“Interesting,” she said after a moment. “Eleven years ago, when you were expelled from the Circle, certain pages from the Forbidden Books disappeared. It’s good they’ve been found, and enriched with commentary. That you dared to use Alzur’s Double Cross, well, well. I don’t think you’ve forgotten how Alzur ended. A few of his creatures supposedly still roam the world, including the last one: the vypper, which massacred him and destroyed half of Maribor before escaping into the forests of Transriver.” She folded several parchments into quarters, tucked them into a pocket on the puffy sleeve of her jerkin. She unrolled the next ones.

“Aha,” she said, frowning. “The Tree-Root Pattern, slightly modified. And here, the Triangle within a Triangle, a way to induce a series of mutations and enormous growth in body mass. And what served as your base creature, Fregenal? What is this? It looks like an ordinary spawęk. Fregenal, something is missing here. You know what I’m talking about, I hope?”

“I’m glad you noticed,” the sorcerer grimaced. “An ordinary spawęk, you say? When this ordinary spawęk comes out of the pass, the world will be struck dumb with horror. For a moment. And then it will start screaming.”

“Alright, alright. Where are the spells that are missing here?”

“Nowhere. I didn’t want them to fall into the wrong hands. Especially yours. I know the whole Circle dreams of the power one can have thanks to them, but no dice. You will never manage to create anything even half as dangerous as my kościej.”

“It seems you’ve been hit on the head, Fregenal,” Visenna said calmly. “And to that, too, must be attributed your inability to regain your thinking capacity. Who here is talking about creating? Your monster will have to be destroyed, annihilated. By a simple method, reversing the binding spell, that is, with the Mirror Effect. Of course, the binding spell was attuned to your wand, so it will have to be re-attuned to my chalcedony.”

“A lot of ‘will have to be’s’,” the fat man snarled. “You can sit here and ‘will have to be’ until Judgment Day, my oh-so-clever miss. What a ridiculous idea that I would betray the binding spell to you? You won’t get anything out of me, neither alive nor dead. I have a block. Don’t stare at me like that, or that stone will burn through your forehead. Come on, untie me, I’m numb.”

“If you want, I can kick you a few times,” Korin smiled. “That’ll get your circulation going. It seems you don’t understand your situation, bald pate. In a moment, the peasants you’ve greatly tormented will burst in here and tear you apart with four horses. Have you ever seen how that’s done? First, the arms tear off.”

Fregenal tensed his neck, bulged his eyes, and tried to spit on Korin’s boots, but from his position, it was difficult – he only spattered his own chin.

“That much,” he snorted, “that much I care for your threats! You won’t do anything to me! What do you imagine, vagrant? You’ve stumbled into the middle of matters that are beyond you! Ask her why she’s here! Visenna! Enlighten him, it seems he thinks you’re a noble savior of the oppressed, a fighter for the well-being of the poor! But this is about money, you cretin! About serious money!”

Visenna remained silent. Fregenal strained, the ropes creaking, and with an effort, he rolled onto his side, bending his legs at the knees.

“Maybe it’s not true,” he yelled, “that the Circle sent you here to turn back on the golden tap that stopped flowing?! Because the Circle profits from the mining of jasper and jadeite, collects tribute from merchants and caravans in exchange for protective amulets, which, however, as it turned out, don’t work on my kościej!”

Visenna did not speak. She did not look at the bound man. She looked at Korin.

“Aha!” the sorcerer shouted. “You don’t even deny it! So it’s common knowledge now. Formerly, only the elders knew about it, and brats like you were kept in the belief that the Circle was established only to fight evil. It doesn’t surprise me. The world is changing, people are slowly beginning to understand that they can do without spells and sorcerers. Before you know it, you’ll be unemployed, forced to live off what you’ve stolen so far. You care about nothing but profits. That’s why you’ll untie me immediately. You won’t kill me or hand me over to die, because that would expose the Circle to further losses. And the Circle won’t forgive you for that, that’s clear.”

“That’s not clear,” Visenna said coldly, folding her arms across her chest. “You see, Fregenal, brats like me don’t pay much attention to worldly goods. What do I care if the Circle loses or gains, or even ceases to exist. I can always make a living curing bloat in heifers. Or impotence in fungi like you. But that’s not important. What’s important is that you want to live, Fregenal, and that’s why you’re wagging your tongue. Everyone wants to live. That’s why, right here, right now, you will betray the binding spell to me. Then you will help me find this kościej and destroy it. And if not… Well, I’ll go for a walk in the forest. Then I can tell the Circle that I couldn’t keep the enraged peasants under control.”

“You were always cynical,” the sorcerer gritted his teeth. “Even back then, in Mayena. Especially in your dealings with men. You were fourteen, and there was already much talk about your…”

“Stop it, Fregenal,” the druidess interrupted. “What you’re saying makes no impression on me. Nor on him. He’s not my lover. Say you agree. And let’s end this game. Because you do agree!”

Fregenal shot a look with the whites of his eyes, turned his head away.

“Sure, I do,” he rasped. “Do you take me for an idiot? Everyone wants to live.”

**VIII**

Fregenal stopped, wiped his sweaty forehead with the back of his hand.

“There, beyond that rock, the gorge begins. On old maps, it’s marked as Dur-tan-Orit, Mouse Ravine. It’s the gate to Klamat. We must leave the horses here. On horseback, we don’t have the slightest chance to approach him unnoticed.”

“Mikula,” Visenna said, dismounting. “Wait here until evening, no longer. If I don’t return, don’t go to the pass under any circumstances. Go back home. Did you understand, Mikula?”

The blacksmith nodded. Only four villagers were left with him. The bravest. The rest of the unit had melted away on the road like snow in May.

“I understood, lady,” he muttered, eyeing Fregenal. “However, it’s strange to me that you trust this cursed one. In my opinion, the peasants were right. His head should have been cut off. Just look, lady, at those piggish eyes, at that treacherous face.”

Visenna did not answer. Shielding her eyes with her hand, she looked at the mountains, at the entrance to the gorge.

“Lead on, Fregenal,” Korin commanded, tightening his belt.

They set off.

After half an hour’s march, they saw the first wagon, overturned, smashed. Behind it, a second, with a broken wheel. Skeletons of horses. A human skeleton. A second. A third. A fourth. A pile. A pile of broken, crushed bones.

“You son of a bitch,” Korin said quietly, looking at a skull through whose eye sockets nettle stalks were already pushing through. “These are merchants, right? I don’t know what’s stopping me from…”

“We had an agreement…” Fregenal interrupted hastily. “We had an agreement. I told you everything, Visenna. I’m helping you. I’m leading you. We had an agreement!”

Korin spat. Visenna looked at him, pale, then turned towards the sorcerer.

“We had an agreement,” she confirmed. “You will help me find him and destroy him, then you will go your own way. Your death will not bring back those who lie here.”

“Destroy, destroy… Visenna, I warn you once more and repeat: put him into a lethargy, paralyze him, you know the spells. But don’t destroy him. He’s worth a fortune. You can always…”

“Stop it, Fregenal. We’ve already talked about this. Lead on.”

They went on, cautiously avoiding the skeletons.

“Visenna,” Fregenal panted after a moment. “Do you realize the risk? This is no joke. You know, with the Mirror Effect, things can go variously. If the inversion doesn’t work, we’re done for. I’ve seen what he can do.”

Visenna stopped.

“Don’t be difficult,” she said. “Who do you take me for? The inversion will work, if…”

“If you haven’t deceived us,” Korin interjected, his voice hoarse with rage. “And if you have deceived us… You said you saw what your monster can do. But do you know what I can do? I know a cut after which the one cut is left with one ear, one cheek, and half a jaw. One can survive it, but one can no longer, among other things, play the flute.”

“Visenna, calm this murderer down,” Fregenal babbled, pale. “Explain to him that I couldn’t have lied to you, that you would have sensed…”

“Don’t talk so much, Fregenal. Lead on.”

Further on, they saw more wagons. And more skeletons. Mixed, tangled, rib cages whitening in the grass, tibias protruding from crevices, skulls grinning eerily. Korin remained silent, gripping the hilt of his sword in his sweaty hand.

“Be careful,” Fregenal panted. “We’re close. Walk quietly.”

“From what distance does he react? Fregenal, I’m talking to you.”

“I’ll give you a sign.”

They went on, looking at the walls of the gorge, steep, overgrown with gnarled stumps of bushes, marked with streaks of gullies and scree.

“Visenna? Do you sense him yet?”

“Yes. But indistinctly. What distance, Fregenal?”

“I’ll give you a sign. It’s a pity I can’t help you. Without my wand and ring, I can’t do anything. I’m powerless. Unless…”

“Unless what?”

“This!”

With a speed one would hardly suspect him capable of, the fat man snatched an angular fragment of rock from the ground and struck Visenna on the back of the head. The druidess fell without a sound, face down. Korin swung his drawn sword, but the sorcerer was incredibly agile. He dropped to all fours, avoiding the blade, somersaulted under Korin’s legs, and with the stone he hadn’t let go of, slammed it into his knee. Korin howled, fell, the pain momentarily robbed him of breath, and then a wave of nausea rushed from his bowels to his throat. Fregenal sprang up like a cat, preparing to strike again.

The mottled bird dropped from above like a missile, brushing against the sorcerer’s face. Fregenal jumped back, waving his arms, dropped the stone. Korin, supported on his elbow, slashed with his sword, narrowly missing the fat man’s calf, who turned and bolted back towards Mouse Ravine, screaming and cackling. Korin tried to get up and pursue him, but the attempt to rise from the ground clouded his eyes with darkness. He fell again, hurling a string of vile curses after the sorcerer.

Fregenal, at a safe distance, looked back, stopped.

“You failed witch!” he roared. “You red-haired hag! You wanted to outsmart Fregenal? Graciously spare my life? Did you think I’d calmly watch you kill him?”

Korin, still cursing, massaged his knee, calming the throbbing pain. Visenna lay motionless.

“He’s coming!” Fregenal screamed. “Look! Enjoy the sight, because in a moment my kościej will gouge your eyes from your skulls! He’s coming!”

Korin looked around. From behind a rocky rubble, about a hundred paces away, the gnarled joints of bent, spider-like legs emerged. After a moment, a torso at least six meters in diameter, flat as a plate, earthy-rust colored, rough, covered with thorny protrusions, rolled over the pile of stones with a rattle. Four pairs of legs advanced steadily, dragging the bowl-shaped body across the scree. The fifth, first pair of limbs, disproportionately long, was armed with powerful crab-like claws, bristling with rows of sharp spikes and horns.

*It’s a dream,* flashed through Korin’s mind. *It’s a nightmare. Wake up. Scream and wake up. Scream. Scream. Scream.*

Forgetting his aching knee, he rushed to Visenna, tugged at her limp arm. The druidess’s hair was soaked with blood, already flowing down her neck.

“Visenna…” he choked out through a throat paralyzed with fear. “Visenna…”

Fregenal burst into maniacal laughter, echoing off the walls of the gorge. The laughter drowned out Mikula’s footsteps, as he ran stealthily, axe in hand. Fregenal noticed him when it was too late. The axe struck him in the small of his back, slightly above the hips, and embedded itself up to the head. The sorcerer, with a roar of pain, fell to the ground, tearing the handle from the blacksmith’s hands. Mikula stepped on him, wrenched out the bardiche, and swung again. Fregenal’s head rolled down the slope and came to rest, its forehead against one of the skulls lying under the wheels of a smashed wagon.

Korin limped, stumbling on the stones, dragging Visenna, limp and soft. Mikula rushed to them, grabbed the girl, effortlessly threw her over his shoulder, and ran. Korin, though relieved of the burden, couldn’t keep up. He glanced over his shoulder. The kościej glided towards him, its joints creaking, its extended claws combing the sparse grass, grating against the boulders.

“Mikula!” Korin screamed desperately.

The blacksmith looked back, laid Visenna on the ground, ran to Korin, supported him, and they ran together. The kościej accelerated, raising its thorny legs.

“We won’t make it,” Mikula panted, looking back. “We won’t escape…”

They reached Visenna, lying on her back.

“She’ll bleed out,” Mikula moaned.

Korin remembered. He tore Visenna’s pouch from her belt, emptied its contents, ignoring other items, grabbed the rusty, runic-inscribed mineral, parted the red, blood-soaked hair, and pressed the hematite to the wound. The blood instantly stopped flowing.

“Korin!” Mikula screamed.

The kościej was close. It spread its legs wide, its toothed pincers opened. Mikula saw the monster’s eyes swiveling on stalks and the crescent-shaped jaws grinding beneath them. Creeping, the kościej hissed rhythmically: “Tss, tss, tss…”

“Korin!”

Korin didn’t react, whispering something, not taking the hematite from the wound. Mikula reached him, jerked his arm, pulled him away from Visenna, and snatched the druidess into his arms. They ran. The kościej, never ceasing its hissing, raised its legs, grated its chitinous belly against the rock, and swiftly pursued them. Mikula realized they had no chance.

From the direction of Mouse Ravine, a rider in a leather jerkin, a coif of iron rings, with a broadsword raised above his head, galloped at a breakneck pace. Small eyes burned in his hairy face, pointed teeth flashed.

With a battle cry, Kehl charged the kościej. Before he reached the monster, however, the terrible legs closed, catching the horse in thorny pincers. The bobołak flew from the saddle, tumbled across the ground. The kościej, with no visible effort, lifted the horse in its pincers and impaled it on a sharp spike protruding from the front of its torso. The sickle-shaped mandibles snapped shut, the animal’s blood gushed onto the stones, and steaming entrails burst from its slit belly onto the ground.

Mikula jumped up, picked up the bobołak from the ground, but he pushed him away, snatched his sword, screamed so loudly that he drowned out the horse’s death-squeals, and leaped at the kościej. With simian agility, he slipped under the monster’s bony elbow and slashed with all his might straight at its stalked eye. The kościej hissed, released the horse, threw its legs wide, catching Kehl with its sharp spikes, lifted him from the ground, and flung him aside, onto the scree. Kehl crashed onto the rocks, dropping his sword. The kościej made a half-turn, reached with its pincers, and grabbed him. The small figure of the bobołak hung in the air.

Mikula roared furiously, in two leaps reached the monster, swung, and struck the chitinous carapace with his bardiche. Korin, abandoning Visenna, without hesitation leaped from the other side, and with a powerful swing, drove his two-handed sword into the gap between the armor and a leg. Pressing his chest against the hilt, he pushed the blade in up to the guard. Mikula grunted and struck again; the armor cracked, a green, foul-smelling liquid gushed out. The kościej hissed, released the bobołak, raised its pincers. Korin braced his feet against the ground, tugged at the sword hilt, to no avail.

“Mikula!” he shouted. “Back!”

They both bolted, cleverly, in two different directions. The kościej hesitated, grated its belly on the rock, and rushed forward, straight at Visenna, who, with her head hanging between her shoulders, was trying to get up on all fours. Just above her, the mottled bird hung in the air, beating its wings, screaming, screaming, screaming…

The kościej was close.

Both Mikula and Korin leaped simultaneously, blocking the monster’s path.

“Visenna!”

“Lady!”

The kościej, without stopping, spread its claws.

“Aside!” Visenna shouted from her knees, raising her hands. “Korin! Aside!”

They both jumped back, pressing themselves against the walls of the gorge.

“Henenaa fireaoth kerelanth!” the sorceress shrieked terrifyingly, thrusting her hands towards the kościej. Mikula saw something invisible gliding from her towards the monster. The grass flattened to the ground, and small stones rolled aside, as if crushed by the weight of an enormous ball, rushing with increasing speed. A blindingly bright, zigzagging streak of light shot from Visenna’s hands, struck the kościej, and spread over its armor in a net of fiery tongues. The air shattered with a deafening roar. The kościej exploded, erupted in a green fountain of ichor, a cloud of chitinous fragments, legs, entrails; all of it flew upwards, rained down all around, thudded against the rocks, rustled through the bushes. Mikula crouched, covering his head with both hands.

It was quiet. Where the monster had stood moments before, a round crater, spattered with green liquid and strewn with hideous, hard-to-identify, tiny fragments, blackened and smoked.

Korin, wiping green stains from his face, helped Visenna rise from the ground. Visenna was trembling.

Mikula bent over Kehl. The bobołak’s eyes were open. His thick horsehide jerkin was torn to shreds, beneath which could be seen what remained of his arm and shoulder. The blacksmith wanted to say something, but couldn’t. Korin approached, supporting Visenna. The bobołak turned his head towards them. Korin looked at his arm and swallowed with difficulty.

“It’s you, princeling,” Kehl said quietly, but calmly and clearly. “You were right… Without a weapon, I’m trash. And without a hand? Probably shit, huh?”

The bobołak’s calmness terrified Korin more than the sight of crushed bones peeking out from monstrous wounds. That the dwarf was still alive was unimaginable.

“Visenna,” Korin whispered, looking at the sorceress imploringly.

“I can’t, Korin,” Visenna said in a breaking voice. “Completely different metabolism than human… Mikula… Don’t touch him…”

“You came back, bobołak,” Mikula whispered. “Why?”

“Because my metabolism is different… from human,” Kehl said with pride in his voice, though already with noticeable effort. A trickle of blood flowed from his mouth, staining his ash-grey fur. He turned his head, looked into Visenna’s eyes.

“Well, red-haired witch! You foretold accurately, but you must fulfill the prophecy yourself.”

“No!” Visenna moaned.

“Yes,” said Kehl. “It must be so. Help me! It’s time.”

“Visenna,” Korin sighed, a look of terror on his face. “You’re not planning to…”

“Go away!” the druidess shouted, suppressing a sob. “Both of you, go away!”

Mikula, looking away, pulled Korin by the arm. Korin yielded. He saw Visenna kneel beside the bobołak, gently stroke his forehead, touch his temples. Kehl twitched, trembled, straightened, and became still.

Visenna was crying.

**IX**

The Mottled Bird, perched on Visenna’s shoulder, tilted its flat head, fixing its round, unblinking eye on the sorceress. The horse ambled along the bumpy high road; the sky was cobalt and clear.

“Tuuit tuiit trk,” said the Mottled Bird.

“Possibly,” Visenna agreed. “But that’s not the point. You misunderstood me. I hold no grudge. I’m sorry I only found out about the whole affair from Fregenal, and not from you, that’s a fact. But I’ve known you for years, I know you’re not talkative. I think if I had asked directly, you would have answered.”

“Trk, tuuuit?”

“Of course. For a long time now. But you know how it is with us. One big secret, everything classified, confidential. And besides, it’s just a matter of scale. I don’t refuse payment for healing either, if someone shoves it at me, and I know they can afford it. I know that for certain kinds of services, the Circle demands high fees. And rightly so, everything is getting more expensive, and one has to live. That’s not the point.”

“Twwiiit.” The Bird shifted from one foot to the other. “Korriiin.”

“You’re perceptive,” Visenna smiled bitterly, tilting her head towards the Bird, allowing it to lightly touch her cheek with its beak. “That’s what I’m bitter about. I saw how he looked at me. Not only a witch, he probably thought, but also a hypocritical schemer, greedy and calculating.”

“Tuwiit trk trk trk tuuiiit?”

Visenna turned her head.

“Well, it’s not that bad,” she muttered, squinting. “I’m not, as you know, a little girl, I don’t lose my head so easily. Although, I must admit… I’ve been wandering alone for too long through… But that’s none of your business. Mind your own beak.”

The bird was silent, ruffling its feathers. The forest was getting closer; the road could be seen disappearing into the thicket under an archway of branches.

“Listen,” Visenna spoke after a moment. “How do you think this might look in the future? Is it really possible that people will stop needing us? Even in the simplest matters, in terms of healing? There’s some progress here, take herbalism for example, but can one imagine that someday they’ll deal with, say, croup? With puerperal fever? With tetanus?”

“Twiik twiiit.”

“Some answer. Theoretically, it’s also possible that our horse will join the conversation in a moment. And say something wise. And what about cancer? Will they manage cancer too? Without magic?”

“Trrk!”

“I think so too.”

They rode into the forest, smelling of coolness and damp. They crossed a shallow stream. Visenna climbed a hill, then rode down among heather reaching her stirrups. She found the road again, sandy, overgrown. She knew this road; she had ridden this way just three days ago. Only in the opposite direction.

“It seems to me,” she spoke again, “that we could use some changes. We’re becoming ossified, we’ve clung to tradition too strongly and too uncritically. As soon as I get back…”

“Twiit,” the Mottled Bird interrupted.

“What?”

“Twiit.”

“What do you mean by that? Why not?”

“Trrrrk.”

“What sign? On what post again?”

The bird, with a flutter of its wings, took off from her shoulder, flew away, disappeared among the leaves.

Korin sat leaning his back against the post at the crossroads, looking at her with an insolent smile. Visenna dismounted, approached him. She felt herself smiling too, against her will; moreover, she suspected this smile didn’t look very intelligent.

“Visenna,” Korin called out. “Admit it, you’re not bewitching me by any chance, are you? I feel an immense joy from this meeting, an almost unnatural joy. Ptoo, ptoo, touch wood. It’s magic, no doubt.”

“You were waiting for me.”

“You are incredibly perceptive. You see, I woke up early this morning and found you had left. How nice of her, I thought to myself, that she didn’t wake me for such a trifle as a cursory farewell, which one can perfectly well do without. Who, after all, in these times, says goodbye or hello, it’s nothing but superstition and eccentricity. Right? I turned over to my other side and went back to sleep. Only after breakfast did I remember I had something extremely important to tell you. So I mounted a captured horse and took a shortcut.”

“And what is it that you have to tell me?” Visenna asked, coming closer, tilting her head up to look into the blue eyes she had seen in her dream last night.

Korin bared his teeth in a wide smile.

“The matter is of a delicate nature,” he said. “It cannot be summarized in a few words. It will require detailed explanations. I don’t know if I’ll finish before dusk.”

“At least begin.”

“That’s precisely the trouble. I don’t know how.”

“Sir Korin is at a loss for words,” Visenna shook her head, still smiling. “An absolutely unheard-of thing. So begin, let’s say, from the beginning.”

“Not a bad idea,” Korin pretended to become serious. “You see, Visenna, it’s been a good while since I’ve been wandering alone…”

“Through forests and along high roads,” the sorceress finished, throwing her arms around his neck.

The Mottled Bird, high up on a tree branch, flapped its wings, spread them, tilted its head.

“Trrrk twiit twiiit,” it said.

Visenna pulled her lips from Korin’s, looked at the bird, winked.

“You were right,” she replied. “This truly is a road of no return. Fly, tell them…”

She hesitated, waved her hand.

“Don’t tell them anything.”
