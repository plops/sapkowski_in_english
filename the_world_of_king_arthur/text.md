Okay, this is a substantial task! I will translate Andrzej Sapkowski's "ŚWIAT KRÓLA ARTURA / MALADIE" (The World of King Arthur / Maladie) section by section. Due to the length, I'll start with the cover, table of contents, and the initial sections of "The World of King Arthur." I'll aim to preserve Sapkowski's characteristic style, which is often erudite, a bit informal, and opinionated.

**Please note:** This will be a long process. I will provide the translation in chunks.

The World of King Arthur

Myth — is a true story,
that happened at the beginning.
Mircea Eliade

In th’olde dayes of the King Arthour
Of which that Britons speken greet honour,
All was this land fulfilled of fairye...
Chaucer

HIC IACET ARTHURUS, REX QUONDAM, REXQUE FUTURUS
Inscription on King Arthur’s tomb

Few myths have achieved such a remarkable career as the tales of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The legend, born in the 6th-7th centuries on the British Isles, then almost the Ultima Thule of Europe, struck the bell of European and world culture with a powerful impetus and produced such a resonance that this bell still chimes today—and nearly fourteen hundred years have passed. There are people who do not remember who Zeus’s father was—yet few will be found who do not know who Uther Pendragon was to Arthur. There are people who have no idea who Joshua, Gideon, Elijah, or Jeremiah were—but everyone knows who Merlin was. There are those who are not quite sure what happened with Lazarus of Bethany or what exactly occurred during the wedding feast in Cana—but everyone will faithfully repeat the story of pulling the sword embedded in a stone or anvil.

There are those who do not know what connected Aeneas and the Queen of Carthage, and the fact that this queen bore the name Dido will be news to many. Few, however, will not associate Guinevere with Lancelot, and I believe absolutely no one will hesitate when asked to name Tristan’s beloved. Ask anyone what the name of the lake was where Simon, also called Peter, used to cast his nets, and then immediately ask them to name King Arthur’s castle. And who remembers the name of Siegfried’s sword from the Nibelungenlied or the weapon of Roland, Charlemagne’s paladin? But the name Excalibur, I guarantee, everyone will recall and associate immediately.

So, what caused the deeds and adventures of the ruler of distant Britain and his brave knights to remain so close and well-known to us after fourteen centuries? Why are Arthur, Merlin, Lancelot, and Tristan closer and better known to us than Judas Maccabeus, Achilles, Aeneas, Orlando, or... King Popiel or Walgierz Wdały? Why has the myth of King Arthur, in an unprecedented and unique way, found its way into millions of hearts and imaginations? Why has this legend become

6

a mine of literary motifs at least as rich and frequently used as—though so much closer to us—Greek mythology, the Iliad, the Odyssey, or the Aeneid?
Not only Anglo-Saxons drew handfuls from the myth of Arthur and his knights: Chaucer, Drayton, Warton, Holinshed, Spenser, Milton, Shakespeare, Dryden, Jonson, Pope, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Rossetti, Morris, Tennyson, Yeats, Swinburne, Eliot, Scott, Longfellow, Lowell, Twain, Joyce, and C.S. Lewis, but also Pulci, Boiardo, Ariosto, Tasso, Petrarch, and Dante. Brantôme and Cervantes. Calderon. Goethe, Schiller, and Uhland. And also Sigrid Undset. Jean Cocteau. John Steinbeck. Italo Calvino. Umberto Eco. Zofia Kossak-Szczucka. Maria Kuncewiczowa. And Teodor Parnicki... It is impossible to list them all.

Why Arthur, why his legend?
The answer to these questions can be found in numerous literary and scholarly works. The following text does not pretend in the slightest to be scholarly, as its author was not, is not, and does not intend to be a scholar.[^1]
However, since the bell struck by the Arthurian legend resonates extremely strongly, especially under the vault of the cathedral (or perhaps monstrosity?) of contemporary fantasy literature, let a fantasy author be permitted to chat about King Arthur. Which the undersigned is and intends to be.

Let us begin with the fundamental question—did King Arthur even exist? This may not be such a fundamental question—because none of the possible answers, whether positive or negative, will have any influence on the shape and weight of the legend anymore. Nevertheless, the very attempt to provide an answer may help in understanding the myth. Its sources. And its meaning.

[^1]: My modesty stems in part from ordinary fear—I remember what happened to the “famous historian” pontificating on the Arthurian myth in the film *Monty Python and the Holy Grail*.

History and Legend

The Isles—as we call them today, the British Isles—were exceptionally fortunate when it came to their inhabitants. They were invaded repeatedly, from time immemorial. The invader, after defeating the native population, quickly became an "aborigine" himself, only to be defeated and conquered shortly thereafter by someone else, who in turn became a "native," and so on, round and round. Thanks to this, for good measure, it is not known who the "true native" was there. That is, it would not be known, if not for legends and tales. But since we have legends and tales, we know that the original and primordial inhabitant of the British Isles was the giant Albion, son of Poseidon. From him, the Island took its most ancient name.

But soon the first invader appeared. It was Heracles, who after numerous deeds in southern Europe, desired to become famous among the Hyperboreans as well. Having crossed Gibraltar and set up two pillars there, the hero soon reached the White Cliffs of Dover. The inhospitable Albion rushed at him with a roar, and Heracles struck him on the crown with his famous club. And then he went home. It is worth noting that he was the only conqueror of the Isle of Albion who did so. All his successors either stayed forever or were forcibly expelled.

According to tradition, the next colonizers were the descendants of Noah. Japheth, son of Noah, had a son named Histion, and he, in turn, fathered four sons named Frankus, Romanus, Alemanus, and Britto. Each of them settled in a respective corner of Europe and gave rise to a respective people. Britto, as we can guess, settled on the Isle of Albion; the strait later named the English Channel separated him from his brother Frankus.
The legend does not say which regions of Europe other descendants of Noah's sons settled. I, however, have certain theories regarding the territories chosen by the progeny of Ham.

The English poet John Milton, basing his account on Geoffrey of Monmouth (about whom more will be said), denies the versions given above. According to Milton (and Geoffrey), it was like this:
After the fall of Troy, a handful of Trojans, led by Aeneas, survived the slaughter. The fate of Aeneas was described by Virgil. They are widely known and we
8
will not repeat them here, limiting ourselves to stating another commonly known fact: Aeneas finally settled in Italy and gave rise to the Romans. He had a son, Ascanius, called Julus. Ascanius, in turn, had a son Sylvius, and Sylvius's son was a certain Brutus. This Brutus had the misfortune of accidentally killing his father during a hunt, for which he was exiled from Italy. The exile wandered to Greece, where he met another enclave of Trojans who had fled from the ruined Ilion. They were faring badly; the Greeks oppressed them, tormented them, and made their lives difficult in every possible way. Brutus rallied his countrymen and invoked the example of his great-grandfather Aeneas. "Let us take to the sea," he urged the Trojans, "let us seek our own piece of land. What, is Italy the only one in the world? Aeneas succeeded, and are we any worse? I tell you, lads, we will find ourselves a new homeland, and if we're lucky, we'll find some Sabine women too, it'll be fun."

The Trojans listened and set out. They sailed for a long time and initially without success. Fortunately, the goddess Diana appeared to Brutus just in time, instructing him to sail north of the Gallic shores, to lands where giants lived. For there, a New Troy would arise.
The goddess was not joking. The Trojans, keeping to the indicated course, soon saw the White Cliffs and landed in a place today called Devonshire. It turned out that the goddess had not exaggerated about the giants either—indeed, Albion was swarming with that rabble like ants. "Damn," cursed Brutus, "great-grandfather had it better! The Rutulians were smaller!"
Without deliberating long, Brutus's boys named the discovered land—in honor of their leader—Britain, after which they set about dealing with the giants and gave them a run for their money. Punitive expeditions were even undertaken—one of Brutus's companions, Corineus, ventured far to the west, defeated and killed the rampaging giant Gogmagog there, and settled in the conquered territories, and from his name, this land was called Cornovia—Cornwall.
Brutus, meanwhile, built a stronghold which he named Troianova. This name, over time, transformed into Trinovantum, and today it is London.

Brutus's sons were Locrinus, Albanactus, and Kamberus. After their father's death, they divided the land. Locrinus chose the central part, which is today's England. This land would be called Logres or Logrus after its ruler. Kamberus took the western part (Wales and Cumberland), a land named Cambria or Kymria.[^2] The third son of Brutus, Albanactus, received the North—Caledonia, which is today's Scotland. This country was named Albania.

As we can see, everything would be clear and simple, if not for the fact that no one wants to believe in tales and legends. Anthropologists and archaeologists, on the other hand,
[^2]: From this, Robert E. Howard's Conan the Cimmerian is derived. The name Konan (meaning Great) is borne by many legendary Welsh (Kymric) heroes. Today's official name for Wales is Cymru.

everyone believes. So let us now listen to what scholars say about the original inhabitants of the British Isles.

The oldest identified population of the Isles belonged to the same group as the Greek Pelasgians or the Italic Etruscans. Anglo-Saxon historians call this mysterious people Iberians, because they came—it is believed—from the Iberian Peninsula. Where they came from to the Iberian Peninsula, when they landed on the British Isles, and whether they found and conquered some native, ancient race there—is unknown.[^3]
The Iberians did not leave many traces on the Isles (unless, of course, one counts Stonehenge and New Grange), from which it is inferred that they did not develop like the Etruscans, but remained at a rather primitive level of civilizational development until the arrival on the Isles (c. 6th century BC) of the Gallic Celts—an ethnic group that will particularly interest us.

The Celts traveled a long way—this people originally inhabited regions probably located at the foot of the Alps, on the Upper Rhine and Danube. From there, the Celts made a long, expansive march. Some of them (the Boii tribes) conquered Bohemia (hence Bohemia) and Moravia, and also entered the territories of present-day Poland for some time. Others settled Gaul, which, as Caesar teaches in his *Commentaries on the Gallic War*, is divided into three parts (*Gallia est omnis divisa in partes tres*). These *partes tres* are regions inhabited by tribes speaking different languages and differing in customs. Caesar calls them Aquitanians, Belgae, and Celts, sometimes using the name Gauls for the latter group.

It was these Gallic tribes (excluding the Aquitanians, who did not derive from Celtic roots) that made successive invasions of the British Isles. The first to set out for Britain (6th century BC) were tribes calling themselves Goidels. They settled present-day Ireland and the Isle of Man, as well as Britain up to Cumberland, Cornwall, Devon, and North Wales, initially decimating the aborigines and displacing them from fertile lands, but later allying and integrating with them against a common enemy, new invaders, who were (4th century BC) their Celtic kinsmen, the Belgae tribes, inhabiting the basin of the Meuse river.[^4]
[^3]: Quite recently, a Bulgarian philologist, based on studies of the Hittite and Etruscan languages, proved that these languages derive from a common stem. The Etruscans, the Bulgarian further argues, are a people who came to Italy from Asia Minor. To be precise, they are none other than Homer's and Virgil's Trojans. And if the Etruscans and the British Iberians are related, then the legend of Brutus, a descendant of Aeneas, unexpectedly shows us its other side.
[^4]: The two-stage Celtic invasion of the Isles is evidenced by the fact that to this day Celtic languages are divided into two clearly distinct groups: Goidelic speech (the language of the tribes of the first invasion, i.e., current Irish, Scottish, and so-called Manx) and Brythonic speech (the language of the tribes of the second invasion: current Welsh, Cornish, and Breton, derived from them).
10
Some of the native proto-population of Britain (those supposed Iberians) survived, however, did not integrate with the Gallic Celts, and were not conquered. These were tribes inhabiting the wild, inaccessible highlands and mountains in the north of the Island—Albania, or present-day Scotland. These northern tribes, as we shall see, defended themselves against foreign pressure very effectively and for a very long time.

And in the south, everything went according to stereotype. Invasion, struggle, conquest, integration. The Belgae quickly mastered the entire southeastern lowland, and finally reached the foot of the Grampians, to the River Tweed. The Goidelic Celts firmly held Ireland and Man, their enclaves held out in Cornwall and Wales. Common Celtic roots facilitated integration and understanding in border areas. Over time, the Belgae, mixed with the Goidels, divided into groups and tribal alliances—Celtic, but already Brythonic. One such group the Romans would later call the Brigantes.[^5] And it is from these Brigantes (and not from the mythical Britto or Brutus) that soon the entire population of the Island would receive the name Britons, and the Island itself—Britain. The godfathers would be the Romans. Well, after all, descendants of Aeneas.

The Romans became interested in the Island even before the birth of Christ. In the years 55–54 BC, Julius Caesar campaigned against the Britons. He carried out (I follow Robert Graves, not historians, for I am, after all, a writer, not a historian) two invasions. During the first, the Britons, led by King Cassivellaunus (Caswallawn), put up such fierce resistance that Caesar managed to advance inland only ten miles. The second time, having reinforced his forces to twenty thousand soldiers, he broke through the defense and conquered Centia, present-day Kent. The expedition ended with forcing the islanders to pay an annual tribute, which, by the way, they stopped paying just two years later.

During the reigns of Caesar Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula (c. 30 BC–40 AD), Rome was not interested in Britain and did not demand tribute, aware that this would practically mean a war of conquest, the cost of which was calculated to be too high compared to the expected profits. Therefore, a strategy of trade penetration was pursued towards the Island.

In southeastern Britain, Cymbeline (Cunobelinus), king of the Trinovantes, soon began to rule. Cymbeline's sons, apparently not getting along well with their father, began to flee to Rome and ask for military aid, promising in return recognition of the Empire's suzerainty... and regular tribute. Caligula unexpectedly became enthusiastic about the undertaking. "I shall conquer," he boasted, "Britain from the Scilly Isles to the Orkneys!" Then he set out. Having arrived with his army in Boulogne, he ordered the legionaries to hack at the sea with their swords and collect seashells, which he considered a victory
[^5]: The other more important Brythonic tribes were called (in Latin): Carveti, Votadini, Deceangli, Coritani, Dobunni, Catuvellauni, Trinovantes, Durotriges, Atrebates, Cantiaci, Silures, Ordovices, Iceni, Demetae, Parisi, and Dumnonii. The historical King Arthur is believed to have come from the Silures tribe, inhabiting southern Wales.

over Neptune and a tribute from Britain. The "intervention" ended there. Caligula returned to Rome, and there Cassius Chaerea was already sharpening his dagger...

Cymbeline died in the same year that Cassius Chaerea's dagger reached Caligula (41 AD). After the king's death, his family jumped at each other's throats in a struggle for power. One of Cymbeline's sons, Caratacus (Caradawg), declared himself king of the Trinovantes. Another son, Bericus (Verica), according to family tradition, fled to Rome and appealed to Claudius for help in the fight against his brother.
Claudius precisely and scrupulously prepared the campaign. He studied the memoirs of Julius Caesar, skillfully formed an expeditionary corps. In the year 43, with forces of forty thousand soldiers, he crossed the Strait of Calais and attacked the Britons, heading straight for Caratacus's capital, Colchester. Caratacus and his son-in-law Togodumnus (Kattigern) blocked the Romans' path near Brentwood, but were defeated in battle. Claudius declared the conquered part of the island (the Southern Lowland—Kent, Sussex, and Essex) a Roman province. He left a contingent here under the command of Aulus Plautius (not Ostorius), and himself—in the manner of Caesars—organized a triumphal entry into Rome.

But already in the year 45, Caratacus again gathered forces and attacked the Roman garrisons. Initially, he achieved successes, but soon he was captured through treachery and handed over to the Romans by his own kinsmen. Brought to Rome and placed before Claudius in chains, he delivered his own defense speech in surprisingly fluent Latin, so eloquently that the moved emperor spared his life. Having toured and seen Rome, Caratacus uttered the famous words: "I do not understand how the rulers of such a magnificent city can, in the depths of their hearts, desire our wretched island huts."

Poor Caratacus. He did not understand that Rome never had enough of what a conquered island could give: gold, silver, iron, tin, lead, hides, grain, cattle, slaves. The Romans did not abandon their plans to conquer Britain; more legions flowed across the Channel. In the year 47, Britain was occupied as far as the rivers Severn and Trent.

The Britons did not give up easily. The courage and fierceness with which they defended their lands amazed the Romans. Although Pax Romana soon became a fait accompli in Britain, the Celts and Britons did not lay down their arms. In the years 60–61 (not 60-69), when almost the entire Island was conquered, they rose up in arms against the invaders under the leadership of the warrior Boudicca (Boadicea), queen of the Iceni. Boudicca fought bravely. She routed several legions, slaughtering seventy thousand Romans and their collaborators. She had captured legionaries impaled on sharpened stakes, which quite effectively weakened enemy morale.
Resistance, however, was futile—the uprising was bloodily suppressed. Boudicca did not agree to the shame that had befallen Caratacus—she took her own life. Her monument stands today in the city that she razed during the revolt—in London, by Westminster Bridge.
12

Soon after, in the year 78, the Roman general Gnaeus Julius Agricola completed the conquest, defeating the last defending Britons at Mons Graupius in Caledonia.[^6] From that date, the full and undivided Roman rule over the Island became a fact. Britannia became another province of the Empire.

But note—the Far North once again effectively resisted the aggressors, again it was not conquered! The wild fastnesses of Coed Celyddon, the inaccessible highlands and ravines of Caledonia, and the passes of the Grampians, bravely defended by the wild mountain tribes, again proved to be an insurmountable barrier. Just as the Celts once had, now the disciplined Roman legions, whose eagles had flown victoriously across half the world, had to yield before the fierceness and courage of the natives. The highlanders of the North charged into battle in war paint, so the Romans began to call them *Picti* (the Painted Ones). The cohorts had to withdraw, the North remained free, and the brave "Painted Ones" did not limit themselves to defense. They attacked themselves, bit back so effectively that the Romans eventually had to wall themselves off from them. As was their custom, they built two successive *limes*, defensive border walls, marking the boundaries of Roman possessions, intended to keep the Picts in check and prevent their marauding raids. In the years 122–127, Hadrian's Wall (*Vallum Hadriani*, cutting across the northern part of the Island on the line of today's cities Carlisle and Newcastle) was built, and in the years 140–142, the Antonine Wall (*Vallum Antonini*, at the latitude of present-day Edinburgh). North of the Walls were the Picts, south of them—Pax Romana.

As in all Roman provinces, Pax Romana, however, meant not occupation, terror, and exploitation, but above all development and progress: civilizational, economic, cultural. Britain was divided into four provinces: Maxima Caesariensis, Flavia Caesariensis, Britannia Prima, and Britannia Secunda, whose capitals were Londinium (London), Lindum (Lincoln), Corinium (Cirencester), and Eburacum (York). Each province was governed by a vice-prefect, while the whole was under the authority of a prefect, or governor-general. Military power was in the hands of two military commanders (praetors)—one bore the title Dux Britanniarum, was based in Eburacum, and oversaw the northern forts of the *limes*. The other, Comes Littoris Saxonici, watched over the security of the coast (from Portsmouth to the Wash), exposed to raids by Saxons and Normans.
In places where ancient Celtic *caers*, or strongholds, were located, further Roman towns, forts, and fortified camps arose: Camulodunum (Colchester, former capital of Cymbeline and Caratacus), Dubris (Dover), Venta Belgarum (Winchester), Isca (Caerleon on Usk), Isca Dumnoniorum (Exeter), Glevum (Gloucester), Aquae Sulis (Bath), Corstopitum (Corbridge), Deva (Chester), Segontium (Caernarvon), Venta (Caerwent), Luguvalium (Carlisle), and many, many others.
[^6]: This battle (based on Tacitus's account) is picturesquely described by Marion Zimmer Bradley in her book *The Forest House*.

(Page 14 contains an illustrative map)

The Romans stayed in Britain for 400 years. A very long time. But eventually, they had to leave. The reason was simple—for centuries they had invaded and colonized other peoples and lands, for hundreds of years they had brought Pax Romana to other nations and imposed it by force. And then it so happened that suddenly someone knocked on their own doors with the hilt of a sword. The Visigoths were already approaching the walls of Roma Aeterna, the Eternal City.

The exodus of the Romans from Britain did not happen suddenly. The Romans left gradually. And although the last Roman legion left the Island in 407, plenty of Romans remained in Britain. Legionaries who had landholdings here, grants for good service, those who had integrated with the Britons through marital ties, merchants. Assimilated representatives of the Roman aristocracy, connected by marriages to the Celtic hereditary aristocracy, gave rise to a new ruling class—the British aristocracy, nobility, who, since the time of Caratacus, had been equally fluent in Latin and Celtic.

But there were also those who joyfully welcomed the retreat of the invaders. For pockets of anti-Roman resistance had smoldered in Britain throughout the full 400 years of occupation. Clan leaders, following the example of the already mentioned Boudicca, regularly incited revolts and uprisings. Although legions stood as far as the Antonine Wall, right under the nose of the Dux Britanniarum, in the mountainous regions of Wales, Dyfed and Gwynedd, in Yr Wyddfa, Rheged, and Cornwall, Roman authority practically did not exist—clans and druids still ruled here. And when the Romans were gone, the clans immediately jumped at each other's throats. A long and fierce struggle for power and dominance began.

The absence of Roman legions and the prevailing chaos did not escape the notice of their neighbors. On the western coasts, the sails of Irish pirates, then called Scots (Scoti), appeared. And from the north, forcing their way through the Antonine and Hadrian's Walls abandoned by the Romans, the indestructible Picts swept south...
The pro-Roman faction repeatedly appealed to the Empire for help—only to hear that the Empire was not interested in the Province of Britain. Britain was self-governing and independent, so it should solve its own problems. Help from Rome would not come. Rome had other, more important matters on its mind.

These more important matters were, as one can easily guess, Alaric's Goths, ravaging the city. These were the last gasps of the Empire, which until recently had ruled half the world. In the year 476, the Western Roman Empire fell and never rose again.

But let's return to Britain. In the war of clans and factions, a figure emerges here (around the years 441–442) who is half-legendary, half-historical. A warrior, a clan chieftain, a kind of *capo di tutti capi*, who probably seized power by slaughtering or subordinating other pretenders. His name was Vortigern. Undoubtedly a Briton (one need only note the similarity of the name to Togodumnus/Kattigern, Caratacus's kinsman), but supposedly married to a pure-blooded Roman woman, and an aristocrat from the line of Caesars at that, Vortigern achieved success after success. He
15
unites Roman and British factions, achieves significant victories in the fight against the Irish, and for a time drives the Picts, who were ravaging the North, beyond the Antonine Wall. Truly, a providential man, whom Britain had awaited with longing. Vortigern establishes order. Vortigern rules Britain.
And Vortigern loses Britain—the Britain of the Britons. With—as history will show—permanent effect. Vortigern becomes the British Konrad Mazowiecki—or rather, Konrad Mazowiecki learned nothing from Vortigern's history.

Vortigern knows that the Picts will not be kept behind the post-Roman Walls for long, because legions no longer stand on the Walls. A whip is needed for the Picts. And Vortigern finds such a whip. Around the year 443, allies arrive on the Island, brave warriors who will fight for Britain and for Vortigern, who will show the Picts where crayfish winter. These are Germanic tribes—Angles, Jutes, Frisians, and Saxons. Soon this whole rabble will be referred to by the common name Saxons.[^7] At their head stand Hengist and Horsa, and above them flies their emblem—the White Horse.

The alliance is cemented by Vortigern's marriage (did he poison the Roman woman?) to Hengist's daughter. The Saxons receive the right to settle on the Isle of Thanet and in the coastal part of Kent. Furthermore, they are promised ownership of all the territory they conquer from the Picts—everything on the north side of the Antonine Wall will belong to them. The Saxons eagerly set to work and indeed give the Picts a sound thrashing. They do not limit themselves to defending the Roman *limes*—they land on the Orkney Islands and from there attack the Picts' rear in the far north. And new ships continue to sail to Britain, carrying new warriors... and hundreds of new settlers.
The settlers look around. Lands north of the Wall, in wild Caledonia? Why look so far? There is plenty of beautiful and fertile land here, in Britain, in Kent and Sussex, it can be taken immediately after landing. This is a rich country, not like our barren Jutland, stony Frisia, or the marshy mouth of the Elbe. There is plenty of everything here. And if something is lacking, it can easily be taken from the stupid, sluggish Britons, those pseudo-Romans! The Picts have been doing this for centuries and are thriving, let's model ourselves on the Picts!

[^7]: The Jutes, as the name suggests, inhabited the Jutland Peninsula, and the Frisians Frisia. The Anglian tribes had their seat in the region of present-day Schleswig-Holstein. The Saxons inhabited the North Sea coast from the river Ems to the mouth of the Elbe, i.e., the northern part of present-day Bundesland Niedersachsen (Hamburg, Bremen). What we today associate with Saxony (and Saxon porcelain), i.e., the vicinity of Magdeburg, Leipzig, and Meissen, is a much later creation and not geographical, but political: the lands taken from the Polabian Slavs were christened—how patriotically and Germanicly—Saxony.
There is a theory according to which the ancient tribal name of the Saxons comes from the short, single-edged swords they used, called *sax* or *saex*. Though it could be the other way around.
16

Celtic clan strongholds and Roman villas go up in smoke. The Saxons press forward, the Britons retreat in panic. They already know they have brought enemies upon themselves, compared to whom the painted Picts seem like gentle lambs. Desperate, Vortigern tries to negotiate, decides to come to terms with the Saxons, to establish borders and demarcation lines. A hundred British chieftains meet at a peace conference with a hundred of Hengist's thanes. Everyone—as a sign of peace and friendship—arrives unarmed. Beer foams, pigs and sheep sizzle on spits. Let us rejoice! Long live friendship between nations!
And where does this celebration take place? On Salisbury Plain. In the stone circle of Stonehenge, called the Dance of the Giants.
At a sign given by Hengist, daggers flash, until then cleverly hidden in the boots of the Saxon thanes. Before Vortigern's eyes, wide with horror, a terrible massacre takes place, which will go down in history as the Night of the Long Knives. The first Night of the Long Knives—humanity, fond of good examples, will later treat itself to several more.

Vortigern miraculously saves his life, escapes to hide in the Cambrian Mountains. This is the end of his political career. And—it seems—the end of Celtic Britain. An end to the pretense of friendship and alliance! This is simply another invasion. Soon the entire eastern part of the Island is in Saxon hands. Britain begins to shrink to the size of Somerset, Devon, Wales, and Cornwall. Wotan and the White Horse rule over the rest of the country.

But then another providential man appears. The last true Roman (though probably a Briton, like Vortigern), who passes into the chronicles under the name Ambrosius Aurelianus. And with the title Dux Bellorum. Having defeated and removed Vortigern (probably with an indelicate slash of a knife across the throat), Ambrosius repels the Saxons to the east, rebuilds and strengthens the forts abandoned by the Romans, and fortifies British clan strongholds in the Roman manner. He reconstructs the road network, significantly strengthens the country's economy and trade with the continent. But the Saxons, though they fail to capture fortified cities and strongholds, still continuously and practically with impunity ravage the country with plundering raids. There is still no way to deal with the Saxons.

And here the legend begins.
The aging Ambrosius Aurelianus, Dux Bellorum, appoints his successor from among the clan leaders. Uther Pendragon becomes him, but not everyone agrees with this choice. Gorlois of Cornwall, lord of Tintagel castle, openly renounces allegiance to Uther. Some claim, however, that the enmity between Uther and Gorlois does not stem solely from political rivalry. Uther's eye lingered a little too long on the beautiful Igraine, Gorlois's wife. The war that begins is a war for a woman...
Uther's advisor is the wise and powerful sorcerer (druid) Merlin. Through Merlin's magic, Pendragon, possessed by lust, takes on the appearance of Gorlois—no one,
17
not even Igraine, recognizes the camouflage when Uther enters Tintagel castle. Igraine does not recognize him even in the marital bed.
Uther wins the woman and power, defeats the clans confederated against him. Gorlois dies in battle, others pay homage to the victorious leader, Pendragon becomes the new Dux Bellorum and marries Igraine. Igraine gives birth to a son—the fruit of that night in Tintagel. Then, however, the sorcerer Merlin appears, reminding Uther that the magical camouflage, thanks to which the Dux was once able to possess Igraine, had its price—the child conceived that night is to belong to Merlin...

Young Arthur—for that is the name of Pendragon and Igraine's son—is given by Merlin into the care of the knight Ectorius. The boy grows up with Ectorius's son, Kay. Years pass. Uther Pendragon, Dux Bellorum and Comes Britanniarum, dies—supposedly having choked to death on a chicken bone. Who will now rule Britain? Who will take up the work of Ambrosius and Uther, who will stop the Picts and Saxons?
On the day of the Imbolc festival, which ends winter, the clan leaders gather in Londinium, in a place where a huge stone stands. A steel anvil is embedded in the stone, and a sword is thrust into it. Whoever can pull the blade from the anvil and the stone, proclaims an inscription, is the rightful ruler of the Britons. Well, lads, to work, who will pull it out?
Some do not even try—perhaps because they cannot read—who the devil knows what is really written on that stone? Others, confident in the strength of their shoulders and arms, make the attempt. Phew... Shit... Next, please.
Many strong men try, none succeed. But then, fifteen-year-old Arthur, ward of the knight Ectorius, grasps the hilt of the sword. And the sword of prophecy, drawn from the stone, flashes in his hand! "Look, Britons," cries Merlin, "here is the rightful heir of Uther Pendragon! Here is your king! King Arthur!"

The prophecy fulfilled before the eyes of all British clans shakes the country—everyone who is alive hastens to the orders of the young ruler. The army that is formed attacks the Saxons. Arthur fights eleven victorious battles with the descendants of Hengist and Horsa. Eleven times he routs them and beats them soundly, for the core of his army is cavalry, an unstoppable mounted troop of young daredevils in the charge. And the Saxons, though their emblem is the White Horse—fight anachronistically—on foot. And they lose.
The twelfth, decisive battle, fought on the fields near Badon Hill, ends in a terrible defeat for the Saxons—the moral and military strength of the Teutonic invaders is totally broken. Albion, Britain, the Land of Logres, can be reborn; the country, saved from the threat of invasions, has many years of peace and prosperity in prospect under the wise and just rule of Arthur, supported by his mounted knights, who sit with him in Camelot castle, at the Round Table...
Legend?
18

We will return to the fact that Arthur, Dux Bellorum, appears in numerous written accounts—and there were many such sources. Scholars studying the Arthurian myth—and there were also countless of them—however, drew attention to other facts, arising from simple logic, confirming the historical authenticity of this figure.
The expansion of the Saxons in the years 443–505 developed energetically and at an astonishingly rapid pace. And in the years 505–516, it suddenly stopped, got stuck in place. Something happened. A historical event took place that pacified the Saxons for a time long enough for them to transform from plunderers and invaders into settlers, peacefully cultivating the land in the eastern part of the island. Into settlers who finally integrated and merged with the descendants of the Britons to give rise to the Anglo-Saxon nation—who, in turn, were soon conquered by the Normans from Normandy, led by William the Conqueror. And what event is capable of turning warlike plunderers into peaceful citizens? Of course, a terrible thrashing that the plunderers receive. And so someone undoubtedly gave the Saxons a thrashing, someone broke their backs for many years. Archaeology confirms this fact. During those long years (505–550), there is no trace of typical Saxon relics beyond the supposed demarcation line, beyond which the victor pushed the Saxons after inflicting defeat upon them, a line running roughly along the eastern edge of Salisbury Plain (present-day Hampshire) north through the Chiltern Hills to the line of the rivers Trent and Humber.

So who stopped the Saxons in the east, halted the invasions and expansion? Obviously—it must have been a talented military commander, a true Dux Bellorum, moreover popular and charismatic enough to unite and subordinate the Briton clans, to form a disciplined army from them. How did this leader defeat the numerous, battle-hardened, hitherto undefeated Saxons? Obviously—by employing a strategy and tactics that were deadly to the opponents, for which they had no countermeasure. Roman tactics. Sources and research confirm that although the core and strength of Roman formations usually consisted of a compact infantry formation, in the troops stationed in Britain, cavalry, called *cataphracti*, prevailed, proving more effective in clashes with the swift chariots of the Celts and with the Picts, who employed commando hit-and-run tactics. What may interest us—in the opinion of some historians, two thousand cavalrymen originating... from Sarmatia were stationed on Hadrian's Wall. According to Roman custom, after completing their service, soldiers acquired the right to settle in the region where they had served. It is therefore not excluded that the later Knights of the Round Table learned the art of mounted combat from the descendants of "centaurs" from the Sarmatian steppes, trained in Roman tactics.

So what does a capable commander oppose the Saxons with? Swift maneuver and a devastating cavalry charge, modeled on the Roman *cataphracti*, perhaps improved, even more adapted to local conditions. He opposes the Saxon infantry hordes with horsemen armed with a long, Brythonic sword, which in the opinion
19
(Page 20 contains an illustration of a knight on horseback)
of arms experts had a blade significantly longer than the Roman *gladius*, so the short Germanic *saxes* could not withstand it. These horsemen were also protected by a shield (*scutum*) and armor (*lorica segmentata*), supplemented perhaps by a mail shirt of iron rings (*lorica hamata*), which most historians and arms experts (e.g., Andrzej Nadolski) consider to be an invention of the British Celts. These horsemen, moreover, quickly discovered the advantages of the heavy spear, the later lance, a weapon that could only be used from horseback. A weapon that, more than a thousand years later, would tip the scales at Kircholm and Vienna.

So we have logical proof of the existence of such a commander and of armored knights, we have logical proof of victory in a decisive battle. Why then, on principle, doubt the records of chroniclers who locate this battle at Mount Badon, named this capable commander Arthur, and his cavalry the Knights of the Round Table?
What kind of chroniclers were they, what and how did they write about Arthur, how did they influence the final shape of the myth—I shall tell.

Arthur in Chronicles, Arthur in Poetry

The first mentions that might concern Arthur appear in the works of the Welsh monk Gildas (516?–570). In *De excidio et conquestu Britanniae* (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain), there is talk of the battle of Badon, which according to Gildas took place on the day of his birth—that is, around the year 516. However, there is not a word in Gildas about who—personally—was the victor. The name Arthur does not appear.

Another Welshman, also a monk, Nennius, produced (c. 796) a work entitled *Historia Brittonum* (History of the Britons)—and here we already have Arthur, named by name and with the epithets Dux Bellorum and Comes Britanniarum. Nennius lists the locations of all twelve of Arthur's victories, including the crowning achievement, the battle of Mons Badonicus, in which Arthur "with his own hand" struck down 960 (!) opponents.
Leaving aside this incredible knightly feat, it is worth adding that to this day scholars vie with each other with theories regarding the actual location of the twelve battles mentioned by Nennius. There is neither sight nor sound of agreement. Even Badon Hill, the site of Arthur's most famous battle, has as many as six locations: Bath, Avon, Badbury, Brentwood, Berkshire, and Bathampton.[^8]

In the *Annales Cambriae* by an unknown author, written around the year 956, the date of the battle of Badon is precisely set at 516. The date and circumstances of Arthur's death are also given—he fell in the battle of Camlann, in the year 537.

The period in which the Arthurian legend was born in orally transmitted folk tradition and permeated into chronicles (years 550–950) Joseph Campbell calls the mythogenic moment.[^9] According to Campbell, the next was the first period of development of oral transmission (950–1066) in which the legend of Arthur as the hope of Britain arose—a king who did not die at all, but resides on the Isle of Avalon
[^8]: The other eleven battles of Nennius are (in chronological order): 1. on the river Glein, 2, 3, 4, 5. — on the river Dubglas, 6. on the river Bassas, 7. at Cait Cellydon, i.e., in the Caledonian Forest, 8. at Caer Guinnion, 9. at the City of Legions, 10. on the river Tribruit, 11. at Agned Hill. Nennius's names do not quite fit any known locations, an exception might be the City of Legions (Caerleon). The battle in the Caledonian Forest, in the far North, must have been fought rather with the Picts than with the Saxons, who had not yet reached Caledonia at that time.

(in a Welsh mountain cave, in the Antipodes, among elves, in the depths of Mount Etna's crater, etc.).[^10]

Then follows the second period of development (1066–1140). After the conquest of the Island by William the Conqueror, Campbell argues, an era of development of bardic poetry and a period of wild popularity of their works ensues. The Franco-Normans adored bards, and no celebration at a Norman lord's castle could take place without a bard's performance. During this period, a multitude of elements of Celtic mythology and heroic tales permeated the Arthurian legend. Norman knights wanted to hear tales of the knightly deeds of the paladins of the Round Table, while Celtic bards, suffering from a lack of material, attributed to Arthur's knights the deeds of Cuchulainn, Finn Mac Cumhail, Diarmuid, Taliesin, Gwydion, Peredur, Lleu Llaw Gyffes, Pwyll, Manawyddan ap Llyr, and other gods and heroes, protagonists of local, Irish, and Welsh legends, which were already being collected and incorporated into the *Mabinogion*, the Welsh *Handbook for Young Bards*. We will return to this fact. For now, however, let's look at the chronicles—for Campbell's second period was also accompanied by the development of the legend in written accounts.

It was during this period that *Gesta Regum Anglorum* (Deeds of the Kings of the English) was written by the learned monk William of Malmesbury (1080–1143). Brother William (traditionally) describes Arthur's deeds at Badon, but—note—the book simultaneously contains the first scholarly critique of the myth in history. William draws attention to the mountain of fabrications and nonsense with which the historical and glorious figure of King Arthur is overgrown and severely criticizes confabulators and storytellers. Immediately after this, however, the scholar repeats—quite seriously—that in the battle of Mons Badonicus, Arthur with his own hand slew over nine hundred Saxons.[^11]

The most important Arthurian document of this period, however, was Geoffrey of Monmouth's *Historia Regum Britanniae* (History of the Kings of Britain) (1100–1154), describing the earliest history of Britain (from Brutus the Trojan) and making King Arthur's reign the apogee and culmination of this history. The book appeared in 1139 and caused a terrible uproar. Even contemporary scholars proclaimed it an apocryphon, nonsense, humbug,
[^10]: King Arthur's Cave is located in Wales, near the town of Monmouth, Trefynwy in Welsh. Other (according to local traditions) resting places of the king are Arthur's Cairn (Carnedd Arthur) in Snowdonia, the Neath Valley in South Wales, the locality of Cadbury in Somerset, and also the Eildon Hills in Scotland.
[^11]: The poet Michael Drayton (1563–1631) verifies this incredible number. According to Drayton, Arthur killed "only" three hundred Saxons at Badon, I quote:
*Pendragon’s worthie son, who waded there in blood*
*Three hundred Saxons slew with his owne valiant hand.*
As for me, I lean towards the theory that recommends removing the last two zeros from biblical and legendary figures to make them more plausible. If one does so, then according to Nennius, Arthur at Badon slew nine and six-tenths of a person, and according to Drayton—exactly three.
23
and patented hogwash. Geoffrey assured that in writing his *History...* he used an original document in the language of the Britons, which he received as a gift from the Archdeacon of Oxford. It was almost unanimously decided that this "original British document"—like the rest of Geoffrey's "facts"—was mere fabrication, falsification, and confabulation. This opinion by no means prevented this undoubtedly apocryphal work from becoming a hit and bestseller almost overnight—there was no court in civilized Europe at that time where the *History...* was not read aloud or discussed. For the work was interesting... literarily. Geoffrey, though he gave the book a serious and scholarly character, did not limit himself to a dry, chronicler's mention of Arthur, but included a whole novel—the circumstances of the king's birth, his rise to power, the acquisition of the sword Caliburn, his marriage to Guanhamara (Guinevere) and her betrayal (with Medraut, the king's nephew, not son), the battle between Arthur and Medraut ending in the death of both rivals at Cambula (Camlann), Guanhamara-Guinevere's asylum in a convent, and finally the king's last journey to Avalon in the year of our Lord 542. He also named Arthur's principal, later canonical, companions: Walgan (Gawain), Kai, and Bedivere. In addition, he stuffed it full of legendary and fairy-tale elements. He also included the wizard Merlin—his entire story, not omitting the magical transportation of the Stonehenge stone circle from Ireland to Salisbury Plain, was contained in the works *Prophetiae Merlini* and *Vita Merlini* (1134–1140). Thus, as we see, Geoffrey of Monmouth laid the actual cornerstone for the later shape of the legend, and the copyright to it undoubtedly belongs to him. Not one of the later authors strayed far from the structure built by Geoffrey. And the contribution of the *History of the Kings...* to English literature was truly colossal—one can boldly state that without Geoffrey of Monmouth, there would be no Chaucer and no Elizabethan drama. And if there were no Chaucer and no Elizabethan drama... Hmmm...

The next period (1136–1230) Joseph Campbell calls the literary period and divides it into the following four sub-periods:

A. The Anglo-Norman Patriotic Epic (1137–1205)

The Arthurian legend, in Geoffrey of Monmouth's version, suddenly acquired political significance. The tale of a powerful king of England, Wales, Ireland, Normandy, and Brittany, of a king who conquered Gaul, Aquitaine, Rome, and Norway, tickled the imperial fancies of the descendants and successors of William the Conqueror—Henry I, Stephen of Blois, and Henry II Plantagenet. The legend needed to be popularized and developed to strengthen the patriotic unity of the nation under the rule of a single monarch and to justify territorial claims. The prosaic *History of the Kings...*, pretending to be a chronicle, was translated into French poetry—for cultured
24
England then spoke French. The translation was done by the monk Wace (1100–1175), author of the work *Geste de Bretons*, also known as *Brut*, because Wace took as his starting point the legend, already known to us, recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth, about the origin of the Britons from Brutus, great-grandson of Aeneas of Troy.

Half a century later, Layamon, a cleric from Worcester, translated Wace's work into an alliterative epic in the Anglo-Saxon (Old English) language—thereby creating two amusing paradoxes. Firstly, his imperial-patriotic piece appeared at a time when the country was beginning to fall apart and plunge into chaos under the rule of King John Lackland. Secondly—Layamon sang of Arthur's deeds in the language of the people whom King Arthur had thrashed and for which he was most famous.
Both mentioned authors essentially do nothing beyond translation work—the fundamental shape and image of the legend remain identical to Geoffrey's. However, we owe Wace something of paramount importance to the legend—he was the first to describe the Round Table, and even its dimensions—fifty knights sat at it. The priest Layamon, on the other hand, explains the significance of the shape of the piece of furniture, which was supposed to put an end to the disputes common among Celtic chieftains over the place of honor at the feasting table. Both works speak of Arthur as the "hope of Britain"—the king did not die, the king was taken by elves to Avalon, from whence he will return when things in his homeland become truly dire. The legend, as we see, begins to serve not only political purposes but also the uplifting of hearts.
This is not the last purpose it will serve.

B. French Courtly Romance (1160–1230)

For the French, who had their own epic about Charlemagne and romances about the deeds of his paladins (the so-called *chansons de geste*), the figure of Arthur as King of the Britons was neither poetically resonant nor interesting, and the English chauvinism of the legend could only hinder them. What did arouse interest in France, however, were Arthur's companions, the Knights of the Round Table, because the fashion at that time was for tales of individual deeds, solitary expeditions... and of love. The ideal and main theme of the songs and romances of French trouvères was courtly love, *amour courtois*—the amorous adventures of brave knights and their deeds, performed in honor and defense of beautiful ladies. At the courts that patronized trouvères and troubadours (e.g., in Poitiers under Eleanor of Aquitaine), the matter of Arthur and Britain (*matière de Bretagne*) became a popular theme for ballads. And a specialized type of ballad and love romance from the *amour courtois* group became the so-called *romans bretons*, which dealt with the loves and liaisons of the Knights of the Round Table.
25
The period we are discussing is a time of powerful expansion of the Arthurian myth into Europe. The poetry of French trouvères was known and popular everywhere, because the French language of that time, *langue romaine*, was then the language of all civilized Europe—other tongues and scripts were only just being born. Old French was used and popular in Britain long before the invasion of William the Conqueror. At the Battle of Hastings, Anglo-Saxon and Franco-Norman knights hurled French insults at each other.

Chrétien de Troyes (1135–1183), court poet of Marie de Champagne, is the most famous trouvère who began to use Camelot exclusively as a backdrop for the first scene—here the adventure began, from here the knight set out on an expedition—Arthur gave him his blessing and appeared no more in the tale. More important—and central—were the knights.
Chrétien wrote a whole series of rhymed romances about "good knights." Most of them (*Tristan, Erec and Enid, Cliges, Yvain*) have their counterparts in the written versions of Welsh romances and epics that were emerging at the same time, but for good measure, it is still not known who modeled whom—Chrétien on anonymous Welshmen, or vice versa. This does not change the fact that the root was evidently the same—Celtic mythology. The songs of Celtic bards, sung (in French!) in the castles of Anglo-Norman knights, traveled to continental Europe and were already as popular there as in England. Do you remember Zofia Kossak-Szczucka's *The Crusaders*, the scene where Robert of Normandy's bard sings songs about "Keus, the good seneschal"? It is the year 1097, the First Crusade—Chrétien de Troyes and Geoffrey of Monmouth have not yet been born, but this scene can by no means be considered a literary anachronism. The deeds of Arthur, Kay, and the entire *matière de Bretagne* could have been known to the crusaders. Kossak-Szczucka, however, commits an anachronism in detail in this scene—and even in two details. We will return to this.

What should be considered truly original, created by Chrétien from scratch, however, is the romance *Lancelot, or The Knight of the Cart* (*Lancelot ou li chevaliers a la charette*). It will interest us because of its pioneering inclusion of this important knight and the matter of his love for Arthur's wife, Queen Guinevere, into the structure of the legend. Chrétien's romance sings of the well-known and later canonical story of the queen's abduction by the wicked Prince Meleagant and her rescue by the heroic Lancelot of the Lake. Lancelot, having lost his warhorse, must hasten to the queen's aid on a peasant's cart—hence the title. The tale must have madly moved knights at the time and wrung tears from the cornflower-blue eyes of ladies—after all, for a dubbed knight, riding on a peasant's cart was terribly shameful! Someone from Meleagant's castle, seeing the approaching Lancelot, cried out: "Oh, a knight on a cart! They're probably taking him to be hanged!" Lancelot in the romance endured this shame without batting an eye, sacrificed his pride and knightly honor for his beloved, for he loved
26
fervently and sincerely. Chrétien knew how to titillate the audience; that is the hallmark of great bards!
And Chrétien de Troyes was a great bard. In his rendition, the Arthurian legend for the first time becomes literature. Art. The theme and message recede into the background—what becomes important is the form and manner of telling the story—*la conte*. *Voilà le grand conteur!*

*Perceval, or The Story of the Grail* (*Perceval, ou li contes del graal*), Chrétien's last work, is again a serious contribution by the poet to the structure of the Arthurian legend. Something appears that has not been there before. The Grail.
The titular Perceval the Welshman is an innocent simpleton who wishes to become a knight. Before he reaches Arthur's court, he experiences various amusing adventures. Chrétien again teases the audience—the playful French are particularly amused that Perceval is *pucelle*, a virgin, who regularly and comically misses opportunities—that is, the ladies he encounters.

And now for the promised detailed anachronism of Zofia Kossak-Szczucka: during the First Crusade, Perceval and the Grail appear in the ballads of the Norman bard and in the conversations of the crusaders, but they had no right to appear, neither one nor the other. Both Perceval and the Grail were introduced by Chrétien de Troyes eighty years later! If Kossak-Szczucka's bard had sung of the Welsh Peredur, there would have been no anachronism.

We return to Chrétien's romance—to the virgin Perceval who—now a knight—arrives at the mysterious castle of the Fisher King, suffering from an incurable wound. Perceval is shown a strange vessel, called the Grail... He is also shown a spear dripping with blood...
And here an unexpected turn in the story occurs. A mystery begins, some secret rite is performed before the audience's eyes. A Great Mystery. And the story breaks off. Perceval did not ask the question the Fisher King expected. And Chrétien did not finish the work. He left an enigma...
An enigma to which we shall return.

C. Religious Tales of the Grail (1180–1230)

These include the trilogy *Joseph of Arimathea, History of the Holy Grail*, and *Merlin and Perceval*, written between 1190 and 1198 by the Burgundian poet Robert de Boron. Only the first part of the trilogy has survived to our times. The other two are unknown to us and we will never know them. They are lost.
What we do know, however, is more important—the so-called Vulgate Cycle, which consists of the *History of the Holy Grail, History of Merlin, Books of Lancelot, Quest for the Holy Grail*, and *Death of Arthur*. The Vulgate Cycle was created between 1215 and 1235 by a team of anonymous Cistercian monks. There is a theory that
27
the monks were inspired to write down (and to Christianize) the legend of Arthur much earlier by their great confrere, Bernard of Clairvaux, protector and reformer of the order, one of the greatest moral authorities of that era. Bernard of Clairvaux perfectly understood the didactic and moral significance of the legend—and its socio-technical role.[^12]

The Vulgate Cycle constitutes another powerful development and enrichment of the myth. On the basis of Geoffrey of Monmouth's *History...* and Chrétien de Troyes' romances, the monks add further building blocks, the most important of which are:
— the history of the Grail and the exodus of Joseph of Arimathea,
— the lineage and powerful development of the character of Lancelot of the Lake, elevating this knight to the leading hero of the legend,
— the sinful affair of Lancelot and Guinevere, King Arthur's wife,
— the slightly less sinful affair of Lancelot and the virginal Elaine, from which the virtuous, pious, and pure as a teardrop Galahad is born,
— the countless adventures of Arthur's knights: Lancelot, Gawain, Kay, Bors, Lionel, Perceval, Ector de Maris, etc.,
— the quest for the Holy Grail (unsuccessful for sinners, crowned with success when the pure Galahad undertook this mission),
— Mordred's revolt and betrayal as a direct consequence of Guinevere's and Lancelot's sin, the massacre at Camlann as a kind of Götterdämmerung and a warning to posterity not to sin.

As can be seen, the legend begins to serve another purpose. A frontal attack by the Church begins, calculated to annex a legend that is fundamentally secular, and even pagan in its origins, to use it as its own tool of influence. Firstly—a code of the truly Christian knight is to be created—and not in the form of dry commands and warnings thrown from the pulpit, but in the form of an easily digestible and universally liked myth. The Arthurian legend in the Vulgate aims to show that knightly ideals and the ethics of knighthood have religious, even evangelical, origins, and knighthood plays a redemptive role—it is nothing other than the armed wing of the Church.
[^12]: In attributing the authorship of the Vulgate Cycle to Cistercians inspired by the teachings of St. Bernard, I rely on Joseph Campbell, because I trust him. There are, however, other theories—some researchers name the Templars as authors, others believe that the author was Gautier Map. This last claim is terribly amusing, because Gautier Map died in 1209. A quite numerous group of scholars, with convenient yet disarming honesty, claim that nothing is known.
28
Secondly—moral norms. Love, *amour courtois*, recently sung by Chrétien before a moved audience of enamored couples, shedding tears over the heartfelt woes of Tristan or Lancelot, becomes sinful and impure in the Vulgate Cycle. Woman, in legend, recently an object of admiration and reverence for trouvères, and sometimes even worship, becomes, in accordance with doctrine, *instrumentum diaboli*.
It is fair to say, however, that the Vulgate Cycle is an interesting, professional, and extremely innovative literary work. The work takes the form of a multi-volume novel and is written in prose. The Vulgate is thus distinguished from the orally delivered romances of the trouvères by its elite character—prose is intended for silent reading, and therefore exclusively for those who can read. In prose, there is no room for making the text attractive with rhyme, rhythm, and accent—that is, the bard's interpretation. Prose must have an attractive form and attract the reader with literary technique. The anonymous authors of the Vulgate used the so-called *entrelacement* (interweaving) technique, what we today sometimes call a nested narrative—one story begins, another interrupts it, soon the second is interrupted by a third, only to return to the first, and so on. And the plot has lost none of its attractiveness to this day. The Vulgate reads wonderfully.
The Arthurian legend in Poland was introduced to the reader mainly through translations of precisely the Vulgate Cycle.[^13]

D. German Heroic Epics (1200–1215)

We are talking about Hartmann von Aue (1168–1210), author of the epics *Erec* and *Iwein*, modeled on Chrétien de Troyes (and indirectly on Welsh tales); Wolfram von Eschenbach (1170–1220), author of *Parzival*; and Gottfried von Strassburg (1170–1215), author of the epic *Tristan und Isolt*, modeled on Thomas of Britain; as well as Ulrich von Zatzikhoven, continuing Chrétien's character of Lancelot. Following the example of the French trouvères, the Germans pushed the person of King Arthur and the matter of Britain into the background, focusing attention on the figures of the knights.
The contribution of the German *Minnesänger* to the Arthurian legend, however, consisted mainly in attempts to complete Chrétien's *Perceval* and explain the enigma of the Grail. The greatest merits here belong to the knight Wolfram von Eschenbach (he was indeed a master, a virtuoso of the lance, victor of numerous tournaments).

The German versions of the Arthurian legend contributed to the wider dissemination of the myth in Europe—both contemporary to the authors and in much later times, when a period of renewed fascination with Arthur, the Grail,
[^13]: Last translation: *Opowieści Okrągłego Stołu* (Tales of the Round Table), adaptation (significant abridgment) by Jacques Boulenger, PIW 1987, translated by Krystyna Dolatowska and Tadeusz Komendant. Quoted fragments of the Vulgate in this text come from this translation. An exception is the story of the knight Bors, in which I allowed myself some *les belles infidèles* to make it funnier.
29
and the Round Table occurred. Richard Wagner based his operas on the poetry of his native *Minnesänger*.
There is also no doubt that the legend of Arthur first reached Poland and Bohemia in a German adaptation and language version. In Germany, to this day, Arthur is invariably called Artus, and this form was formerly accepted in our country as well—and has survived in the name of the famous Artus Court in Gdańsk, or in Boy's translation of Villon's *Great Testament* ("Artus, diuk Bretaniey chrobry..." - "Artus, the brave Duke of Brittany..."). Only later in Poland did the legendary king begin to be called Arthur—but in the Czech Republic, he is still Kral Artuš, as in Germany.

It seems that the Arthurian legend first penetrated Poland (in the 13th century) through Silesia, through the mediation of such princely patrons and protectors of poets as, for example, Bolko I of Świdnica, Henry III the White of Wrocław, or Henry Probus, at whose courts bards and *Minnesänger* swarmed, and the western knightly tradition was very much alive. It is also worth mentioning the Teutonic Knights, who had "Artus courts" in most of their castles. Among the great admirers of the legend was the commander of Człuchów, and later Grand Master of the Order, Konrad von Wallenrode, initiator of the famous Teutonic "Arthurian feasts"—after conquering, slaughtering, and burning some Samogitian, Lithuanian, or Polish locality, an "Arthur's round table" was organized, a feast for twelve pious brothers who had most distinguished themselves during the massacre.

The 14th and 15th centuries bring further development of interest in Arthur and the Round Table. In England, the romance *Sir Gawain and the Green Knight* is created, probably the work of the anonymous author of the famous *Pearl*. Thomas Chestre adds Sir Launfal to the ranks of the Knights of the Round Table, a knight modeled on Lanval from Marie de France's 12th-century ballad. In France, two anonymous works and two new heroes appear. The first is *Perlesvaus, Le Haut Livre du Graal* with the titular Perlesvaus. The second: *Perceforest*, linking the Arthurian myth with the history of Alexander the Great and introducing the titular Perceforest (He Who Pierces the Forest) to the ranks of Arthur's knights. The myth also becomes popular in countries less connected with the legend—Lancelot of the Lake becomes the titular hero of an anonymous epic in the Netherlands. In Portugal (Castile?), other anonymous authors create further new heroes of the legend—one is Amadis de Gaula, or the Welshman, also called the Knight of the Burning Sword, the other—Palmerin d'Inglaterra, or the Englishman. The tales of Amadis and Palmerin gain enormous popularity—both are mentioned in Cervantes' *Don Quixote*. Amadis (as Amadigi) finds his way into Italian poetry (Bernardo Tasso).

And finally, the time came for the culmination and crowning achievement, for the fullest and most famous version of the tale of the King of Albion and his knights. In the year of our Lord 1485, the knight Thomas Malory completed his life's work. *Le Morte Darthur* (The Death of Arthur, not to be confused with the similar title of one of the parts
30
of the Vulgate Cycle) is a true monument to the legendary king and the beautiful, good, bygone knightly times. It is worth knowing that the greater part of the work was created in prison, where the good knight Malory spent a good few years for... armed robbery and rape.

Malory collected and used everything created by his predecessors, so it is no wonder that *Le Morte...* is so extensive and full—and sometimes pushed to the limits of redundancy. Outside the prison windows where the writer sat, however, the murderous, bloody, and cruel War of the Roses was raging, in which knightly ideals and virtues dissolved in the gore, mud, and muck of the battlefields of Wakefield, Bosworth, Barnet, and Tewkesbury. It is no wonder, then, that Malory's work is filled with nostalgia, sadness, and a poignant *memento mori*.
*Le Morte...* is a masterful book, wonderfully written, constituting one of the most interesting examples of English prose in general. It also broke a record that few books—apart from the Bible—can boast: from the moment it was printed by William Caxton's then-famous printing house in Westminster in 1488 until today, *Le Morte...* has never for a moment been out of print—there has never been a time when this book was not being printed and sold somewhere. Except that little remained of Malory's original version. Suffice it to say that no reader ever knew the author's version—Caxton himself, during the first typesetting, butchered the manuscript and changed the order of the chapters (books). Since then, the book has been revised thousands of times—edited, abridged, rewritten anew, supposedly new versions developed based on supposedly rediscovered manuscripts, adapted into versions for tiny, small, medium, and grown-up children, adapted into an opera and into fantasy, from fantasy into a musical, and finally, it was filmed and adapted into a role-playing game. In this way, *Le Morte Darthur* became a classic, and Malory's vision and version were accepted as the obligatory, classic image of the Arthurian myth.

Yes, indeed, obligatory. Literature has totally supplanted history and realism—if we accept the assumption that Arthur was real. We listen to the arguments of "historians" and "realists" with reluctance or reject them outright. Let them say that Camelot, if it existed at all, could not have had high walls and soaring towers decorated with banners—it probably resembled a pile of earth, on top of which stood a thatched hut behind a wooden stockade. Let them say that in the 5th–6th century Arthur, Lancelot, and Gawain could not have worn full plate armor and helmets with movable visors, that they wore at most primitive mail shirts or Roman *loricae* over sheepskin coats and woolen tartans, that the knightly tournament was an absolutely unknown concept to them, and that no custom or knightly ceremony accepted by us today as good coin (e.g., dubbing) existed even in its infancy. That jousting with lances, that favorite, spectacular way of knightly duel, was absolutely unthinkable in Arthur's time—stirrups were not yet known in Europe, without which such a fight is not possible, nor had hollow lances, which could be shattered, yet been invented. Finally, that Sir Lancelot or Sir Gawain could not have been any *sirs*, because this title (as well as the very idea of knighthood, as we perceive it today) was brought to England only by William the Conqueror's Normans...
Let the realists say what they want and as much as they want. We know better. Literature is always right! If not for Homer, not only would we not know how the siege of Troy proceeded—we would not know at all that such an event took place. No historian has brought us closer to the image of Augustus's, Caligula's, and Claudius's Rome than Robert Graves. We know what happened in Russia in 1812 from reading Tolstoy. We know the image of Poland from the times of Mieszko and Bolesław the Brave from Bunsch and Gołubiew, the First Crusade and the capture of Jerusalem from Kossak-Szczucka, and Sienkiewicz informs us exhaustively about the course of the Polish-Cossack wars and the Swedish Deluge. And so it should be.

And it is similar with the Arthurian myth. It was as it is written in Thomas Malory's *Le Morte...* or rather in the adaptation of Malory that we read.
Joking aside. Of course, the "historians" and "realists" are right. Chrétien de Troyes and Malory confabulate and embellish. Arthur was a Briton, a Celt. The true picture of him and his history can only be hidden in originally Celtic tales. Tales whose source and root are Celtic mythology. Even before Malory began his work, around the year 1400, the first written, complete, anonymous collection of basic Welsh legends and myths saw the light of day. The collection had to wait a little longer for an English translation—and popularization—only in 1849 did Lady Charlotte Guest make the translation and give the collection the name *Mabinogion* (meaning *Compendium of a Young Bard*). In the numerous tales (so-called branches) included in the *Mabinogion*, King Arthur appears, how could he not. Except that it is difficult to recognize him, because he is a Welsh Arthur. And as such—probably the real one. Among his companions, we will also recognize the real ones, bearing authentic, not yet distorted names: Kei, Bedwyr, Gwalchmei, Gwalchfaved, Peredur, Owein ap Urien Rheged, Trystan ap Tallwch, Gereint ap Erbin. We will get to know Arthur's real parents, bearing the names Uthr Bendragon and Eigr ferch Amlawdd.[^14]
There is also a queen, Arthur's wife—her name is Gwenhwyfar ferch Orgyrvran. There is also a wise advisor—the druid Taliesin Pen Beirdd. And the king's magic sword? It is there, of course. It is called Caledfwlch. Try to pronounce it, and it will become clear to you why Geoffrey of Monmouth preferred the name Caliburn, and Malory Excalibur.

In the years 1066–1230, as I mentioned above, songs of Celtic bards were in fashion. It can be safely assumed that all (or almost all)
[^14]: The patronymic *ap* means son of, and *ferch*—daughter of.
32
authors of subsequent versions of the Arthurian myth were somewhat familiar with Welsh tales and triads,[^15] that they had some orientation in Brythonic legends. And the tales and legends of the Celts have their roots in beliefs, in mythology. To better understand the Arthurian myth, we too must become somewhat oriented in Celtic mythology.

[^15]: The triad was a basic, very popular poetic form in Wales—it was based on the principle of three: three heroic characters or three events in the action, or three statements or morals—or three lines in a stanza. Triads constitute the oldest monuments of Welsh poetry—some of them are considered as old as the language itself. Here is an example of one of the triads (my translation, of course from the English translation):
*Three splendid victorious feasts Britain saw:*
*The feast of Caswallawn,*
*after driving out Julius Caesar,*
*The feast of Aurelius Ambrosianus, after the victory over the Saxons,*
*And the feast of King Arthur in Caerleon on the River Usk.*

**Chunk 4: The Pantheon of the Ancient Britons – Roots of the Legend (Part 1)**

The Pantheon of the Ancient Britons —
Roots of the Legend

The pantheon of the British Celts, those from Wales and Cornwall, is rich and a bit—due to family ties between the gods—complicated. The matter is further complicated by the fact that sometimes it is quite difficult to distinguish gods from demigods or mortal heroes, and vice versa. Gods and heroes are, in fact, equal protagonists of tales and epics, and gods (and heroes) in Britain (similar to Ireland) were worshipped mainly through the songs of bards. Sanctification and cult through poetry were characteristic of the British Celts—hence so little iconographic material that could support our current knowledge of this people's beliefs.

The fundamental pair of British solar deities is the Mother of Gods, Dôn (Dona), and her consort Bel (Beli). Dôn is undoubtedly the equivalent of the Irish (Goidelic) Danu, and the offspring of Dôn and Bel correspond to the Irish Children of Danu, Tuatha Dé Danann. Bel, in turn, corresponds to Belinus, worshipped in Gaul.
The children of Dôn and Bel are Nudd Silver-Hand (a lunar deity) and Govannan (the divine smith, a kind of Hephaestus), as well as Arianrhod (Silver Wheel) and the wise Gwydion, druid of the gods, also depicted as the Welsh Prometheus, because he cared for the welfare of humans and looked after them. Gwydion's mentor and guardian was the divine sage Math ap Mathonwy, Dôn's brother.
Mythology links Arianrhod and Gwydion in a loving (?) relationship, the fruit of which is the most important god of the Britons, the Welsh Phoebus and Apollo, god of light and sun, fertility, patron of all crafts and arts—Lleu Llaw Gyffes, the equivalent of the Irish Lug (Lugh Lamh-fada).
One of the most important centers of worship of Lleu-Lug was Lugudunum, Caer Lial—that is, the Fortress of Lleu, present-day Carlisle.
However, since there is no sun without shadow, the second son of Arianrhod and Gwydion is Dylan, the evil and dark Son of the Wave (the Celts inseparably linked mythological powers of darkness with the powers of the sea).
The son of the lunar Nudd, on the other hand, is Gwyn. Despite his name (Gwyn means White), Nudd's son is a dark god of battle and death, ruler of the Tylwyth Teg,
34
Welsh evil spirits. Gwyn (called Melwas in Cornwall, and Avallach in Somerset) was the Hunter, the Hunter of Dead Souls, traversing the land at night on his ghostly steed. As such, he was undoubtedly the prototype of Herne the Hunter, known from later legends.

The second group of gods (also lunar) derives from Llyr, who ruled over the seas. The main place of worship for the God of the Seas was Caer Llyr, later called Ratae Coritanorum, even later Llyr-Cestre, and now Leicester. Llyr had two wives. One was Penarddun, daughter of Dôn (a symbolic union of the bright sun and the dark sea). The second: the no less symbolic Iweridd (Ériu, meaning Ireland).
Penarddun bore Llyr a daughter Creiddylad and a son Manawydan. "Ireland" Iweridd was the mother of the giant Brân (Raven) and Branwen (She of the White Breast).

The Celtic Hades, the Otherworld, the Land of Enchantment, called Annwvyn, is ruled by the chthonic god Arawn, who is later replaced by Pwyll, a mortal, prince of Dyfed, husband of the beautiful Rhiannon (Great Queen). Their son is Pryderi ap Pwyll. The deities of Annwvyn were hostile to the children of Dôn, but friendly to the children of Llyr. The Welsh Annwvyn, unlike the Greek Hades, was a beautiful land—it survived in fairy tales as the Land of Fairies, Faërie, Fairy Land. And one more important difference between Annwvyn and Hades: the boundary between the living, real world and the land of magic and shadows is very thin among the Celts—crossing it is extremely easy for mortals. There is no Cerberus guarding the gates, and the Styx can turn out to be the first random river in the first random Welsh forest. It happens, however, that easy entry means difficult exit—time in Faërie flows much slower than in the real world, and the natives are reluctant to part with guests. Celtic mythology mainly consists of tales about the loves of gods, their rivalries, and battles. So we have the story of Pwyll's fight with the rulers of the underworld, crowned with winning the beautiful Rhiannon and the title Pen Annwvyn, Prince of the Abyss. We have the story of the love of Gwyn ap Nudd for Creiddylad, daughter of the sea god Llyr.[^16]

We have the conflict of Light and Darkness in the persons of two brothers, Lleu and Dylan. Dylan finally dies from a spear thrust by his uncle, Govannan, and the sea waves lament his death (to this day, the Welsh call the roar of the tide in river estuaries "Dylan's moans").
One of the most interesting—and extremely important for the later Arthurian myth—is the story of Gwydion and Arianrhod. Their love affair is short and leaves no pleasant memories (according to some mythological versions, Gwydion possessed Arianrhod by force). Arianrhod hates the son she bears, the future sun god, to such an extent that she casts three terrible curses upon him, the worst that could befall a Celt: the boy cannot have a name, cannot
[^16]: Shakespeare (following Geoffrey of Monmouth) used Llyr to create King Lear, and made Creiddylad his daughter Cordelia.
35
bear arms, and cannot have a woman of flesh and blood as his wife. Cunning Gwydion, through his stratagems, forces Arianrhod to lift the first two curses—she herself gives her son a name (Lleu Llaw Gyffes—Sure Hand) and arms him herself. As for the third curse, Gwydion and Math ap Mathonwy deal with it themselves—with their magical art, they create a woman... from flowers. The woman, named Blodeuwedd (Flower-Face), becomes Lleu's wife and almost contributes to his downfall. Unfaithful and treacherous, a true Delilah, she deceitfully extracts from her husband the secret of his life force and exposes him to her lover's assassination attempt. But the wise sorcerer Gwydion is vigilant—he saves Lleu, and punishes Blodeuwedd cruelly: he turns her into an owl, a bird condemned to eternal night—and eternal solitude among other birds.

There are also tales of fierce battles of the gods. The giant Brân, son of Llyr, dies during a tragic and bloody expedition against the Irish. His severed head becomes something of a talisman and divine oracle. His sister Branwen (at the time of the tragic affair, wife of the king of Ireland) dies, because her heart breaks with grief at the news of how many warriors lost their lives because of her. As for Brân, it is interesting that the cult of his severed head is stronger than the cult of the god himself. Only after Brân's decapitation does he begin to be titled Blessed (Bendigeid), and his head is called Urddawl Ben (Venerable Head) or Uther Ben (Wondrous Head). Buried in the place of present-day London, Brân's head was supposed to ensure fertility and warn against invasions and disasters threatening the Island.[^17]

Pryderi, son of Pwyll, heir to the Otherworld, constantly schemes (his name means Trouble) and often allies himself in his machinations with Manawydan, son of Llyr—they form a notably evil pair in Welsh tales (a union of Darkness and Sea). Despite this, they seem to be favorite heroes of the Welsh. Pryderi's wife becomes Kigva, while Manawydan marries Pryderi's widowed mother. From then on, the four of them—Pryderi, Kigva, Manawydan, and Rhiannon—are inseparable.
Other gods sharpen their teeth for a magical artifact in the possession of Pwyll and Manawydan—the Cauldron of Inspiration. To obtain the Cauldron, Gwydion sneaks into Caer Sidi (the Revolving Castle), but is captured and imprisoned. Finally, in a climactic, symbolic duel of Light and Darkness, Gwydion defeats and kills Pryderi.

The (briefly and superficially) discussed pantheon of the Celts of Albion does not exhaust all their beliefs. For there was practically no corner of Cornwall and Wales where some specific *genii locorum* were not worshipped. Springs, rivers, lakes, oak groves, and hilltops were sacred and personified; it is impossible to list everything. Additionally, the Romans brought and implanted a multitude of deities on British soil, introducing almost their entire classical pantheon, enriched over time by the cults of Cybele, Isis, and Mithras. Gallic deities were worshipped in Britain—Epona, Nemetona, Belinus, Silvanus, Cernunnos, and Ceridwen. There were also, and mixed with Celtic beliefs, undoubtedly some remnants of little-known beliefs of the original inhabitants of the Isles (Iberians), such as the cult of the fearsome Cromm Cruach in Ireland.
And the link between the world of gods and the world of humans was a caste characteristic of the Celts—the druids.

We remember from reading Robert Graves how fascinated Claudius was with druids during the British campaign, how he admired their enormous influence on society, their mysterious rites, and the secret knowledge and art possessed by these "people of oak and mistletoe" or "oak-men"—the name druid (based on the Indo-European root *dr, drys*) comes from the Celtic words *drui, daur*, and *derwen*, meaning tree, oak—hence also the current English word *tree*, and in all Slavic languages the words *drzewo* and *drewno*.
Druids were a special caste of spiritual leaders of Celtic peoples and tribes. A druid combined the functions of high priest, advisor, lawyer, arbiter, oracle, physician, theologian, scientist, historian, and chronicler. In primitive Celtic society or in a tribal group, the power of the druids was enormous and indivisible—they were not subject in the slightest to any secular authority, and no feudal duties to the ruler applied to them. No Celtic ruler, on the other hand, would dare to disregard a druid's advice—he had to comply with it unconditionally, under penalty of "excommunication," which meant being placed outside society, i.e., complete civil death.

Druids constituted a hermetically sealed caste—we know virtually nothing about their internal affairs, and the meaning of their rites and mysteries (including human and animal sacrifices, burned alive) remains a puzzle to this day—and a field for thousands of speculations. It is known, however, that they were divided into three main groups: druids (i.e., sages and judges), filids (called *vates* by Strabo, i.e., seers and prophets), and bards, whose duty was to know all basic myths and the art of their artistic interpretation before an audience. In other words, these three groups divided among themselves such fields as wisdom, custom, and law (druids), knowledge, including secret knowledge and divination (filids), and poetry combined with propaganda and chronicling work (bards).
The most famous bards and filids of Britain were the semi-legendary Myrddin Emrys, Taliesin Pen Beirdd, and Aneirin. They are credited with the authorship of many heroic Welsh songs and tales—including the oldest monuments of Welsh literature: the *Black Book of Carmarthen* (12th c.), the *Book of Taliesin* (14th c.), and the *Book of Aneirin* (13th c.), as well as countless triads. These bards, of course, were supposed to have lived and created much earlier, in the 5th-6th centuries.
37
The information provided above is, of course, a huge abbreviation, an extremely fragmentary treatment of this interesting mythology. I refer those interested to specialized literature—I myself used mainly Thomas Bulfinch's *Mythology*, Charles Squire's *Celtic Myth and Legend, Poetry and Romance*, and the *Mabinogion*.
Those who prefer fantasy literature, such also exists. Evangeline Walton wrote a cycle of novels corresponding to the branches of the *Mabinogion*: *Prince of Annwn, The Children of Llyr, The Song of Rhiannon*, and *The Island of the Mighty*. Several fragments of the *Mabinogion* branches are almost literally quoted by Stephen R. Lawhead in his "Pendragon" cycle (*Taliesin, Merlin, Arthur*) and he continues the work in a subsequent cycle, which includes the volumes *Song of Albion, Paradise War, Silver Hand*, and *Endless Knot*. Patricia Kennealy-Morrison wrote a four-volume saga set in the world of Celtic beliefs: *The Copper Crown, The Throne of Scone, The Silver Branch*, and *The Hawk’s Grey Feathers*. Alan Garner wrote the novel *The Owl Service*, dedicated to the legend of Blodeuwedd. The Goidelic Children of Danu (Tuatha Dé Danann) and Brythonic deities appear—camouflaged as an alien race, but easy to decipher—in Julian May's *Saga of Pliocene Exile* (*The Many-Coloured Land, The Golden Torc, The Nonborn King*, and *The Adversary*). Much can be read about Celtic beliefs and druidic rituals in Marion Zimmer Bradley's *The Mists of Avalon*—and also in her latest book, *The Forest House*.

But even the meager, abridged, fragmentary material presented here should suffice for a better understanding of some aspects of the Arthurian legend. For the Arthurian legend—like any other—is rooted in mythology—so strongly that several centuries of intense tugging have not managed to tear it away.
And in the years 1100–1500, when the dams broke, this local, Celtic legend spilled over Europe in hundreds of versions and adaptations. The *matière de Bretagne* began to become universal, began to take on colors and shades reflecting the then state of minds, began to express contemporary anxieties and interests of Europe. These interests were then three basic, though strongly conflicting, matters—religion, knighthood, and love.

**Chunk 5: Arthur – Christian or Pagan? – The Religious Aspect of the Myth (Part 1)**
---

Arthur — Christian or Pagan?
— The Religious Aspect of the Myth

What did Arthur believe in?
Until the arrival of the Romans, the souls of the Britons were ruled by druids in the name of a rich and colorful Celtic pantheon. Then the Romans arrived. They, as is commonly known, were religiously tolerant... and adaptive. The Celts worship Bel? Why not, after all, it's Jupiter. They pay homage to Dôn, Brigit, Morrigan, Epona, and Ceridwen, aspects of the Great Mother? All right, after all, it's simply Juno-Minerva-Diana-Venus; we Romans also worship them, and we don't forget Cybele and Isis either. The god Llyr? Surely, it's Neptune, who else?

Regarding the druids, the Romans were less tolerant. Firstly, the druids constantly fanned the smoldering embers of rebellion, and very often they managed to fan them into quite a large flame. The druids incited Cymbeline, Caratacus, Togodumnus, Boudicca, and Cartimandua, and the warriors they led fell into the famous Celtic battle frenzy, transforming into true berserkers. Secondly, the Romans were civilized. And it happened that druids would build a cage-effigy of wicker, a terrifying Wicker Man, lock people inside (later animals), and burn them alive as a sacrifice to the gods. Such druids, as Tacitus writes in the *Annals*, were put to the sword. Of the numerous pogroms of druids, the most famous is the notorious massacre on the island of Mona (Anglesey) in the year 61. Thus was born a tradition that accompanies humanity to this day: the uncivilized who murder should be murdered in a civilized manner. Long live civilization.
The massacre on the island of Mona and the anti-Roman revolts of the Britons incited by the druids in the years 61–78 are described by Marion Zimmer Bradley in her just-mentioned, latest fantasy book, *The Forest House*.

The Romans, as mentioned earlier, stayed on the Island for four centuries. During this time, things changed a bit in Rome too. Under Nero, Christians were thrown to the lions, and the apostle Peter the Fisherman (AD 64) was crucified upside down. About a quarter of a millennium later (AD 313), Constantine the Great issued the Edict of Milan, prohibiting the persecution of Christians and guaranteeing freedom of religion. And shortly thereafter, in 380, during the reign of Theodosius (also
39
the Great), Christianity became the state religion in Rome. In 392, Theodosius issued a ban on all polytheistic practices. Throughout the Roman Empire. In the Roman Provinces as well. So, in Britain too?
Undoubtedly in Britain as well, but not immediately and not entirely. In Rome too, churches were not built overnight. The old gods did not yield so easily, and before Theodosius, there was also Julian the Apostate. In the Province of Britain, far from the central authority and the apparatus enforcing the new religion, this process probably proceeded even more slowly. The assumption that all Romans stationed in Britain and the part of the local population assimilated with them adopted the cross overnight, as one man, is slightly improbable.

Let us also not forget that the opposition of the druids and Celtic Britons did not weaken for a moment. The adherents of the old order, worshippers of Bel and Dôn, Lleu, Nudd, and Llyr, persisting in the mountains of Wales and Cornwall, did not allow Jupiter and the divine cult of the Caesars to be imposed on them, so it probably also happened that they chased away missionaries with the cross to the four winds.
And after the departure of the Romans? Celtic orthodox believers and druids undoubtedly offered thanksgiving prayers to Bel and Lleu; who knows, perhaps out of joy they even lit a fire under a Wicker Man full of people. But true Romans, like Aurelius Ambrosianus, probably remained Christians. The Roman, and therefore Christian, name Ectorius (Hector) is borne by Arthur's guardian...

As for Arthur himself, some English historians believe that he did not get along particularly well with the church of that time, and they see proof of this in the fact that neither the aforementioned Gildas, the leading ecclesiastical chronicler of this period, nor the Venerable Bede (673–735), author of the *Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum*, mention him at all. Both write about the Britons' victory at Badon, and in those (and also later) times, victories were always personal, never collective! Why then do the ecclesiastical chroniclers omit the name of the victor? Because, historians argue, he was disagreeable and inconvenient to the ecclesiastical chroniclers. Unorthodox. He had—as they say now—a not very regulated relationship with religion.
With what cry, then, on their lips did Arthur's knights attack the Saxons, worshippers of Wotan? "Help, Jesus Christ"? Or perhaps: "Guide my sword, Great Goddess"? Or perhaps some shout one thing, and others another? Both in Nennius and in William of Malmesbury, we can read that during the engagement at Badon, when Arthur single-handedly slew over nine hundred men, the image of the Most Holy Mary, Mother of Christ, was on his shield. But Nennius and William wrote at a time when the descendants of Wotan's worshippers, now Anglo-Saxons, had long since (in 597) accepted baptism, and it was simply not proper to paint any other image on the shield of the legendary king in a chronicle. And what if the spiritual leaders of the Britons in the fight against the Saxon Wotan were, however, druids with Merlin (Taliesin) at their head? Was the image on Arthur's shield perhaps not the image of the Great Goddess Dôn? Or the fearsome goddess of war and slaughter, Morrigan? Or
40
Ceridwen or Epona, the Great Goddess in her virginal aspects? According to the text of the Vulgate, during the battles with the pagan Saxons, all kings allied with Arthur fought under the sign of a white banner with a red cross, while the banner of the king himself, besides that cross, was also adorned with the image of a red dragon—a distinctly pagan symbol...[^18]

I am by no means searching for irrefutable proof that Arthur was a pagan—for I would not find it, even if I wanted to very much. In the 5th and 6th centuries, Ireland and Britain were already strongly Christian. St. Patrick (390–461), patron and apostle of Ireland, began his missionary activity in Ulster in 432, and St. Ninian of Solway (c. 360–432), the Scottish apostle, was converting the Picts already at the turn of the 3rd and 4th centuries. St. Columba (521–597), founder of the famous monastery on the Hebridean island of Iona, who undertook Ninian's work, was almost Arthur's contemporary. Contemporary to Arthur—and somewhat legendary like Arthur—was also the patron and bishop of Wales, St. David, who died around the year 600. The British church already had and venerated its martyrs in the 3rd century, including the most famous: St. Alban (?-c. 303), executed by the Romans in Verulamium, the place where the famous abbey stands today in the city of St. Albans.

It is certain that in the 4th century, the British church was already strong and recognized enough for its representatives to attend synods in Arles (314) and Rimini (359). The bishopric in Eburacum (York), probably the oldest in England, dates from 314. Conversion and the propagation of faith in Britain—historians confirm this—proceeded very sensibly, even cleverly: in a way easy for pagan Celts to swallow. Missionaries were little hindered by the old gods; they considered it even beneficial if someone listened to the words of the Gospel leaning their back against a cromlech. Pagan beliefs were not persecuted and condemned wholesale. This is most clearly shown by the delicate and tactful activity of St. Columba of Iona (521–597), who converted the Picts from 563. Seeing that the Picts paid divine honor to springs and wells, the holy man did not shout, spit, curse, or try to picket the springs. He quietly sprinkled them with holy water and drove out the devil. He baptized, as his hagiographers claim, three hundred
[^18]: The Red Dragon is the current emblem of Wales, and its Brythonic provenance is evident. As for the red cross—it was the emblem of the crusaders, ordained after the Synod of Clermont (1095) by Pope Urban II as a symbol of knightly struggle for the faith. For the red cross was borne on the shield of the legendary St. George of Cappadocia, slayer of the dragon and patron of knighthood. This saint supposedly appeared to Richard the Lionheart during a crusade and thereby contributed to winning a battle. That is why in 1222 (only then!) George was chosen as the patron saint of England, and the red cross from his shield became the emblem of England, obligatory to this day. This was also adapted to the Arthurian legend, by placing the red cross on the banners, shields, and tunics of Arthur himself and numerous Knights of the Round Table. A version was also concocted according to which this cross was originally painted with his own blood by Joseph of Arimathea on a shield, which Galahad obtained during the quest for the Grail. An interesting combination of legends, done retrospectively. A kind of—one might say—retro-legend.
41
such springs. The Picts continued to worship the springs, but the springs were no longer pagan, but consecrated. Cunning! By St. Columba's method, which I propose to call the "springlet method," Brigit, the Goidelic goddess of fire, was made into "St. Brigid of Kildare," Brân into "St. Brian" and "St. Brendan the Navigator." Brân's sister, Branwen, was made into the folk Christian St. Brynwen, patroness of lovers. Countless folk saints were created, by the way—there were Cadog, Collen, Dyfan, Eigam, Mochutu, Teilo, Cilgeran, Llawdog, Cynidr, Teulyddog, etc. Even... two of King Arthur's knights—Geraint and Mabon—received beatification (folk, of course). Only two, I have not detected others, which is a pity. "Saint Lancelot" would also sound beautiful.

Joking aside—what was meant to result from the above is what is considered an indisputable historical fact: the conversion and propagation of Christianity in Britain proceeded calmly, patiently, and without conflict. In a surprisingly and unprecedentedly tolerant manner. In other corners of the world, faith in Christ was introduced by sword and whip, idolatry, polytheism, and the cult of old gods were unlearned by capital punishment, teeth were knocked out for breaking fasts, idols (sometimes together with their worshippers) were burned with fire. This did not happen in Britain. For it must be known that Christianity came to Britain not directly from Rome, but from Ireland. Faith was propagated in Britain by a very atypical Christian-Celtic church and its Celtic missionaries.[^19]

Thus, in pre-Arthurian Britain, it was Celtic Christians who converted Celtic pagans, which is why they did it so well and so effectively. The aforementioned monk Gildas writes (in the 6th century) about pagan beliefs, idols, and druids as phenomena long past, forgotten, and sunk into oblivion. In the 6th century, Britain, according to Gildas, is entirely Christian. In the oldest known Welsh versions of the legend, Arthur had an attendant bishop—named Bedwini. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, Arthur's attendant bishop was Dubricius (Brice), who is identified with St. Dyfrig, an (apparently) authentic figure. And Arthur could have been—I repeat—could have been a Christian, and an exemplary one at that. And the fight against the Saxons could also have meant a crusade—a fight of Christ, who came from Celtic Ireland, against Wotan, an alien invader arriving from across the North Sea. It could have been so—Gildas and Bede, contrary to the suggestions of Anglo-Saxon historians, could have ignored Arthur for completely different, non-religious reasons.
[^19]: Ireland (according to legend and tradition) was baptized by St. Patrick in the 5th century, but it is known that even before Patrick, other propagators of faith were active on the Emerald Isle, including the famous Bishop Palladius. Patrick arrived on prepared ground and simply completed the work of his predecessors. It is certain that missionaries who, even in Roman times, ventured to Britain and Scotland—like the aforementioned St. Ninian and St. Columba—were recruited from these predecessors.
42
What really happened, we do not know and will never know. We can only speculate, and in such speculations, we are aided by authors of Arthurian fantasy, such as Marion Zimmer Bradley and her *Mists of Avalon*. We will return to this book.
However, if we were to be guided by the text of the Vulgate or Malory's *Le Morte Darthur*, all doubts should leave us. Arthur and his knights perform all their deeds in God's name, they ask God, thank God, swear by God; in short, they are on the verge of a serious offense against the second commandment. They constantly run to the chapel and fall to their knees. Moreover, they even seek the enlightened advice of the Archbishop of Canterbury—which is quite amusing in light of two facts: geographical and historical. Canterbury (Durovernum Cantiacorum) is located in Kent, very close to the Strait of Dover; in Arthur's time, this was Saxon territory. If there was any temple there then, it was more likely Wotan's. And secondly: the first Archbishop of Canterbury was St. Augustine, later patron saint of England, and this happened only in 601, a good half-century after Arthur's death at Camlann. But Augustine officiated in some modest church, because the famous cathedral was built only in 1017. And it was built not by Arthur, but by... precisely the Saxons, or rather their descendants. It is not excluded that it was built on the site of a former temple of Wotan. For the pagan Saxons defeated the Christian (perhaps) Britons, but not long after, they themselves accepted baptism—this time, however, not from Ireland, but from Rome. According to a purely Roman, untainted by Celticism, rite.
And it was like this:
The baptism of the Saxons was initiated by Pope Gregory II. In 597, St. Augustine (?-631) set out on a mission to Britain. This saint, patron of England, should not be confused with the more famous St. Augustine (354-430, the one of the Augustinians).
St. Augustine of England, shortly after arriving on the Island, baptized Æthelberht, king of Kent (later a saint), and in 604 founded bishoprics in Canterbury (which was the capital of Kent) and Rochester. In the same year, the kingdom of the East Saxons (Essex) was baptized, and the construction of St. Paul's Cathedral in London began. In 625, Æthelberht's daughter from Christian Kent, Æthelburh, married Edwin, the still pagan king of Northumbria, and forced him to accept baptism—so effectively that he became a saint. A saint (after being murdered by kinsmen who disliked saints) was also Edwin's successor, King Oswald (604–642), who, together with Saints Aidan and Cuthbert, strengthened Christianity in Northumbria and built the famous, still existing monastery at Lindisfarne.
But even the baptized Saxons did not forget their old gods. Tiu, Wotan, Thor, and Freya have survived in the English language to this day—in the names of the days of the week: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...
But, as has been said, this was already after Arthur's time—about half a century. In Arthur's time, the Saxons were absolutely and totally "pagan." And Arthur himself?
43
Another example of the piety of Arthur and his retinue, which we could find in the Vulgate and in Malory, is the fact that all important events and ceremonies take place during church holidays or on their eve—the Day of Our Lady of the Candles (Candlemas) and Whitsuntide (Pentecost) dominate.
Agreed. It undoubtedly could have been so, and probably was. Except that the Day of Our Lady of the Candles, or more precisely: the Day of the Purification of the Virgin Mary—is the Celtic Imbolc, a festival of the approaching end of winter, and Whitsuntide (Pentecost, i.e., the Day of the Descent of the Holy Spirit, a movable spring festival) is the Celtic mystery of Beltane, a celebration of the full bloom of spring nature. Imbolc and Beltane, as well as Samhain (end of November, i.e., All Saints' Day) and Lammas (Lughnasadh, beginning of August, i.e., the Day of Our Lady of the Snows) have symbolic significance in Celtic legends—most fateful mythological and legendary events take place precisely on these days. Therefore (regardless of the true date of coronation) Arthur in the original songs of Welsh bards becomes king during the mystery of Beltane. And the pagan mystery of Beltane is changed by missionaries into Whitsuntide.
We know this—it is the "springlet method," patented by Saint Columba.
Well, someone might say, maybe Malory exaggerated a bit with the archbishop, maybe he confused Canterbury with Glastonbury, maybe he muddled church holidays and pagan rites. But in the fact that a righteous knight was pious, Malory did not exaggerate. And if he did exaggerate somewhat, he had reasons, because Malory nostalgically remembered the times when righteous and pious knights roamed the beautiful, happy, sunny Albion on their steeds...
Oh, he longed. He longed. He had reasons.

**Chunk 6: The Ideal of the Righteous Knight & The National Aspect of the Myth**
---

The Ideal of the Righteous Knight

I have already mentioned that *Le Morte Darthur* was created in times of contempt, brought about by the bloody civil war in England between the Yorks and Lancasters. Malory described righteous, noble knights because before his eyes, the horror of the War of the Roses was unfolding: regicide, assassination, murder on the scaffold and murder on the battlefield, venality and betrayal, desecration of the corpses of defeated enemies, breaking of one's word of honor, pacts, and laws of war, violation of the right of asylum in churches, unimaginable cruelty.

Things were no better during the times when Chrétien de Troyes' ballads, the Vulgate Cycle, and German epics were being created. War and crime raged on continental Europe. Popes gouged out the eyes of antipopes and had the mutilated paraded through the city for everyone to see. In the south of France, the massacres of the Albigensians claimed hundreds of thousands of victims and turned Provence and Languedoc into a smoldering ruin, completely destroying the splendid culture of that region. The whole of central Europe turned into a seething cauldron in which, successively and alternately, papal armies, troops of Guelphs and Ghibellines, Germans and Englishmen, Frederick Barbarossa, Philip of Swabia, and who knows who else, swirled. These armies warred with each other, but they posed a real threat to the populations of villages and towns.
There was a psychological antidote to these monstrosities—it was the idealized image of a righteous knight without blemish or stain, with a reliquary on his breast and God in his heart. A knight who prays before battle and spends the whole night after battle in the chapel, lying prostrate. Who will honor a defeated enemy, will not raise his hand against the defenseless, will not harm a woman or child... John Wycliffe and Jan Hus, and earlier Bernard of Clairvaux, called for knights to be just like that. And much earlier, the already known Gildas inveighed against unworthy, unruly knights—he dedicated his work to them, for they were the "ruin of Britain" in the title of his work.

Gildas, however, had a slightly different type of knight in mind. In his time, knighthood was perceived quite differently in Britain. The medieval type of knight and the knightly code, custom, or ceremony are things that are completely alien to the original version of the Arthurian legend. These elements were only introduced by subsequent adaptations, made after the invasion and conquest of the Island by William the Conqueror.
45
In these adaptations, the concept is turned one hundred and eighty degrees. Arthur's warriors cease to be Celtic patriots, heroes of the struggle for the national cause, for saving the country from the pressure of foreign, invading, Saxon culture. They become universal knights, and the idea is turned on its head—Arthur's warriors are not knights because the country is in need, but on the contrary: they fight because they must—they are knights, and a knight—if he is a good knight—must be obedient to the will of God, his lord, and the commands of holy, knightly law. His nationality and private views are of no importance. He must be a good knight. Period.

And at the behest of Bernard of Clairvaux, a cycle of tales from the Vulgate was written about "good knights," and trouvères and troubadours composed romances about them. But they had to resort to legends and myths, because in reality, such knights did not exist. A knight from the army of York or Lancaster, a knight of Barbarossa or Philip of Swabia, a knight from Tewkesbury or Bosworth, from Legnano or Bouvines was, as a rule, a dull and arrogant butcher. And the knight Simon de Montfort, leading a crusade against the Albigensians, was an ordinary criminal. A genocidaire.
Romances were written about knights to whom oppressed ladies brought supplications for help and received that help—because in reality, at the sight of approaching knights, the entire population—and ladies first—fled in panic into the forests. They wrote about faithful vassals, about knights whose word could be relied upon, while in reality, betrayal and perfidy were fundamental elements of strategy and tactics. They described pious and prayerful knights, while in reality...
In 1170, Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, thundered from the pulpit against the so-called Constitutions of Clarendon, proclaimed by King Henry II Plantagenet, which limited the privileges of the Church. The King complained about the insolent cleric to his loyal knights, exclaiming, I quote: "Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?" Four royal knights—Reginald Fitzurse, William de Tracy, Hugh de Morville, and Richard Brito—properly understood and interpreted this cry and the duties of a knight towards his suzerain: shortly after Christmas, on December 29, the archbishop was murdered on the altar steps.

In 1208, the dubbed crusaders of Sir Simon de Montfort captured the city of Béziers in Languedoc, one of the centers of the "heretical" Cathars, or Albigensians. One of the knights asked the papal legate supervising the action, Arnold Amaury, how to distinguish "ours" from "schismatics." "Kill them all," was the reply, "God will recognize His own sheep." Fifteen thousand people were murdered—mostly women and children.
In 1327, the English King Edward II was dethroned and imprisoned in Berkeley Castle. To those who overthrew him—his wife, Isabella, her favorite Mortimer, and Orleton, Bishop of Winchester—the living ex-king was inconvenient. Two nobly born knights—Baron John Maltravers and Sir Thomas
46
Gournay—received an order: Edward must die, but there must be no marks of violent death on his body. The loyal knights Maltravers and Gournay murdered the king by thrusting a red-hot poker into his anus.
In 1369, Edward, called the Black Prince, grandson of Edward II murdered at Berkeley Castle, hero of countless knightly fables for children, called by Froissart[^20] the noblest and worthiest knight who had lived since the time of King Arthur, was waging war with France. Having captured the city of Limoges, the knightly Black Prince spared the lives and freedom of all dubbed knights taken prisoner. He was, after all, bound by a code that mandated solidarity with his knightly brethren. The remaining defenders and inhabitants of Limoges (numbering six thousand, including women and children) were massacred.

In June 1426, the nobility of Thuringia, Saxony, Meissen, and Lusatia, obedient to the call of Pope Martin V, set out on a great crusade. No, not to the Holy Land. Closer. Across the border, to Bohemia, to convert the followers of Jan Hus's teachings by the sword. In the town of Teplice, the noble crusaders burst into a Benedictine nunnery, raped and murdered Catholic nuns, and then plundered everything—including liturgical objects.
In 1427, the knight Stefan de Vignolles, known by the nickname La Hire, one of the commanders in Joan of Arc's army, before an attack on the English, asked a chaplain for absolution of sins. He refused confession, having neither time nor inclination for it. "Then at least pray," suggested the priest. And La Hire, without dismounting, turned his eyes to heaven. "Lord God," he bellowed, "I demand that you aid me in battle! On a reciprocal basis! For if you were La Hire, and I were you, I would support you!"

Only a few examples. But typical. Very typical.
And yet, in our times, the word knight invariably evokes positive associations—we speak of chivalry and chivalrous behavior, a knight's word, a knightly spirit. We had knightly circles in the old cavalry banners and in the old Sejm, a Knights' School... and Pan Wołodyjowski, the Little Knight. An officer still becomes a knight today, struck on the epaulets with a saber during the promotion ceremony. The recipient of the Virtuti Militari order becomes a chevalier; a chevalier was also a young man who, in a knightly, polite, and courtly manner, attended to a young lady and was her guardian and defender. And it was Sleeping Knights who awaited the Day of Great Need in the Tatra Mountains. We also know very well—our history has ensured this—the concept: a knight's death.
*Your statue will be surrounded by a numerous populace,*
*These words the hard stones will preserve:*
[^20]: Jean Froissart (1337–1410), French poet and historian, author of, among others, *Chronique de France, d’Angleterre, d’Ecosse et de Bretagne*. He collected materials for the history of contemporary wars from eyewitnesses of the described events.
47
*"Here lies a knight, who fought without fear*
*And lived without blemish."*
Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz

As for that proverbial "knight without fear and without reproach" (*chevalier sans peur et sans reproche*), it is worth knowing that the first historical bearer of such a title was the famous French knight Arnold Wilhelm de Barbazan (1360–1431), and the second—even more famous—Pierre du Terrail, known as Bayard (1473–1524).
How then, someone might ask, what were these knights really like? If they were indeed so terrible, as the author claims, then from where did these chivalric elements migrate into our culture and our language—and into almost all languages of the world?[^21]
I answer: they migrated from chivalric tales—primarily from the adapted (to a universally European fashion) Arthurian myth. They migrated not only into literature, poetry, and common language, but also into history. For the extraordinarily few, undoubtedly historically confirmed examples of chivalric behavior come from times when the legend of Arthur and his loyal companions from Camelot was already widely known and popular. The few "good knights" simply tried to imitate their literary ideals. As a rule, they limited themselves to appearing in tournaments disguised as "Lancelot," "Tristan," or "Gawain" and decorating their helmets with scarves and ribbons of their "Guineveres" and "Isoldes." In daily life—and especially in war—imitating ideals was much worse.

The Arthurian myth in its successive phases of development did not merely signify nostalgia for the good old bygone days, when truly good, faithful, and pious knights still lived in the world. The myth did not lament the decadence of chivalric culture. There was nothing to lament, because—as many historians argue—one can speak of the decadence of chivalric culture from the moment of the emergence of knighthood and its culture in general. The myth, in reality, went much further:
[^21]: Exceptionally, in our culture and language, another type of knighthood functions strongly—the figure of a knight with a black cross from the Teutonic Order, whose deeds were much closer to the historical truth about knights. The Teutonic Knight from Malbork (in reality probably not at all demonic and little worse than other dubbed knights) nevertheless became in our culture a convenient contrast, the other pole of the ideal. In Sienkiewicz we read:
*"I have often seen how a true knight spares another who is weaker, saying to himself: 'No honor will accrue to me if I trample a fallen man.' And the Teutonic Knight is then precisely most ferocious..."*
History has played a similar trick with German culture and language. Here, besides "knightly deed" (*Rittertat*) and "knightly behavior" (*ritterliches Benehmen*), the word and concept of *Raubritter* (robber knight) functions. For so was called a nobly born and dubbed lord, who engaged—for profit—in robbery and murder. Such historically true knights were a plague and terror in Germany in the 13th–14th centuries—the period of greatest popularity of the Arthurian myth.
48
it created a chivalric utopia. It created an absolutely fictional ideal. The ideal of a knight who never was.
Both of the above matters emerged, as has been said, when the Celtic myth began to fight for a prominent place in European culture, when it began to become universal. This universality—interestingly—however, failed to erase the traces of Celticism, which survived in every, even the most distorted and modernized version of the legend.
49

The National Aspect of the Myth

Arthur was a Celt. Through and through, from his ancestors. More—Arthur was an idealized Celt. He simply had to be. Whoever does not grasp this will never understand the legend.
I have already mentioned Celtic holidays and rituals, I have already spoken of Welsh mythology, and we will return to its references to certain heroes and characters when we deal with the legendary who's who. For now, however, let us pay attention to certain significant principles of Celticism—relating directly to the central figure of the legend—to King Arthur. Arthur, who was the ruler of the Celts.

Even in the most familiar to us, yet most distorted canon of the myth, several phenomena and facts will surely make us wonder. For example: why does Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, have to use Merlin's magic and pull a sword from a stone? Why do clan leaders gather in a conclave to determine who will be the foremost among them? If the throne is not even hereditary, why doesn't the strongest or richest simply seize power?
And it is because the exercise of power among the Celts was understood and enforced in a way unique among contemporary societies. The king (tribal chieftain) was not the owner of the land—the land was common, it belonged to everyone. The ruler received power in the form of a trust—he governed in the name of the people, not in his own. This is very important—because to us, accepting the myth in its medieval (European medieval) form, Arthur appears as a suzerain king, his knights as vassals or liegemen, and the population of the Land of Logres as subjects. Nothing could be further from the truth. A Celtic ruler could not inherit or seize power, and he could not exercise it absolutely. Power was entrusted to him by general consensus, and in exercising it, the ruler was obliged to be guided by the good of the country and the people. This good was understood as the good of the land—under a good ruler, the country, literally understood as the land, was healthy and happy, it flourished and bore fruit, whereas a crisis of power or the chaos of an interregnum meant crop failure, famine, and other plagues. When the ruler's reign was sick—the land sickened. A poorly managed country (this motif repeatedly returned later in literature) turned into the Waste Land, *La Terre Gaste*, The Wasted Land (Eliot).
50
In mythologies and tales from around the world, there is a motif of a hero king who, thanks to his heroic deeds, gains the acceptance of all his people—and to whom the entire people—in recognition of these merits and personality traits—entrusts power. So that he may rule in such a way that the people fare as well as possible. The difference is that throughout the world, such legends were only a psychological antidote to the actual persons of rulers and their conduct. To the awareness that the king is, because he inherited the throne or seized it by force, the land is his property, which he can freely and without restriction dispose of. He rules over subjects by the very nature of subjection and because he has the apparatus of coercion in his hands. He will cease to rule when he dies, or when someone—most often another king—overthrows him.
Among the Celts, such legends also exist—but they are justified by tradition and actual facts. The Celtic king received power in trust—because he was a hero. Because his actual deeds and merits made him worthy of being entrusted with power. The Celtic king fulfilled a service to the people and the land—nothing more. His commands were obeyed when he deserved to be obeyed. Power entitled him to nothing more—in particular, it did not grant him ownership of land or the right to dispose of this right. The land was the common property of all Celts. When one knows this, it is easier to understand the fierce resistance that Norman and English feudal lords faced for centuries from the Welsh, Irish, and Scots. The feudal system of exercising power, which the Normans and English wanted to impose on the Welsh, Irish, and Scottish Celts, overturned and stood on its head their entire Celtic world.

That is why Arthur is acclaimed king of all Britons and the hope of the country. That is why he is the first hero among heroes, why he, and no one else, draws the sword from the stone. It is he, like the god Lleu, who receives the sword Excalibur, a symbol of power, from the hands of the Lady of the Lake (the goddess Arianrhod). That is why, like the hero Cuchulainn, who single-handedly defended Ulster against the entire army of Queen Medb of Connacht, Arthur at Badon, in defense of the country, with his own hand slays nearly a thousand Saxons.

Of course, a solitary Cuchulainn could not have overcome an entire army, Arthur could not have felled a thousand Saxons with his own hand. This is legend. A legend expressing the Celtic longing for a hero king, for an invincible god-king, armed by a goddess (the Great Mother, symbol of the earth) with a magic sword. For a king accepted by the Earth itself, whom—as a trustee of the people's will—he will worthily defend. For a king accepted by all and uniting all. For a king under whose rule the country will flourish and be happy, fertile, healthy...
Of course, there was no such king. It is a myth. A myth that was born in times when the world of the Brythonic Celts was already crumbling under the blows of foreign invaders. In times when it turned out how weak naive, Celtic democracy was against harsh feudalism...
51
The myth of King Arthur.
An unachievable, Celtic ideal. Well, little remains of the Celts. But the ideal remained. Because it was—unlike the Celts themselves—indestructible.
And the legend remained.
For exactly the same reason.

**Chunk 7: The Grail – The Ultimate Mystery (Part 1)**

The Grail — The Ultimate Mystery

"When evening came, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out of the rock. He rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away" (Matthew 27:57–60).

Well, the thing is, Joseph didn't go away. Yes, yes, I know that all the other evangelists—John, Luke, and Mark, as well as the apocryphal Nicodemus—consistently claim the same thing as Matthew. That he went away and that was it, that only two Marys remained at the tomb—Mary Magdalene and Mary, wife of Clopas. But we, after all, know the Arthurian legend!
Joseph of Arimathea did not leave the tomb. Christ appeared to Joseph, alive, and from his wound, the one inflicted by the spear of the Roman centurion Longinus, blood flowed. Joseph took a vessel and collected in it the last drops of the Savior's blood. And only then did he leave, departed Jerusalem, went to the city of Sarras, and from there sailed to Britain. Through his (Joseph's) efforts, all the pagan people of this land returned to the Christian faith. The vessel in which the truest drops of blood, royal blood (*le sang réal, Sangréal, Gréal, Grail, Graal*) were collected, disappeared from this world, was hidden, and Joseph's descendants became hereditary guardians of the Secret. The Grail disappeared, but the wise Merlin had prophesied that one day it would return. And the Grail did return...

As we already know, Chrétien de Troyes was the first to mention the Grail. Except that Chrétien did not finish his romance, which is probably why there is not a word in his work about Christ, nor about Joseph of Arimathea. Not a word. We do not know what the Grail is; in Chrétien's work, the Grail remains a mystery. And one more thing—the mysterious vessel in Chrétien is a bowl or platter (*écuelle*), a vessel such as was used during feasts.
The whole matter resurfaces in the religious version of the legend—in Robert de Boron's (*Joseph d'Arimathie*). There we already have the full story of Joseph of Arimathea, the blood collected in a vessel (which in Boron's work for the first time becomes a chalice, the same one from which Christ drank during the Last Supper), Joseph's exodus to Britain, the passing of the Grail among Joseph's descendants until the last of them,
53
the one who becomes the Fisher King, guardian of the secret of the miraculous vessel until the arrival of the rightful successor...
Whether Robert de Boron was the first to give the Arthurian myth a religious character, or whether the Church had tried to annex King Arthur and the Grail for its own purposes even earlier, we do not know. Nor do we know how evangelical elements crept into the Celtic legend, which undoubtedly constituted a mixture of mythology, tradition, and actual historical events concerning attempts to halt Saxon expansion in Britain. Robert de Boron (like Chrétien, for that matter) refers to some sources known only to him and secret books, which allowed him to learn the actual history of the evangelical Joseph of Arimathea and the miraculous vessel, connected both with the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, and the Resurrection. Such mysterious sources are a motif as old as the world in literature, always alive and always fashionable—not so long ago we spoke of the "Brythonic document" which Geoffrey of Monmouth used in compiling his *Historia Regum...*. And we also had James Macpherson and his fabricated *Songs of Ossian*. The "secret books" and "mysterious documents" from which Robert de Boron learned the truth about the Holy Grail can therefore be safely classified under the same category—which did not prevent them from later being used to draw breathtaking conclusions and deductions.[^22]

Robert's work was taken up by the Cistercians in the Vulgate Cycle, a work which, as I mentioned earlier, was most likely inspired during his lifetime by Bernard of Clairvaux. And here everything becomes clear. There are no secret sources. There is politics. And nothing beyond that.
Interestingly, the chalice invented by Robert de Boron disappears in the Vulgate; the Grail once again becomes a bowl, as in Chrétien. The rest (i.e., the nature and origin of the Grail) is essentially identical. As has already been said, however, the monks introduce into the action a character who was nowhere and never before—their absolute invention—Galahad. Son of Lancelot, born of the virginal Elaine, daughter of King Pelles, granddaughter of King Pellam the Rich Fisher. Galahad, the ideal knight, a direct descendant of Joseph of Arimathea.

The Vulgate Cycle (the part titled *La Queste del Saint Graal*) teaches that the Grail appeared in Camelot precisely on the day of Galahad's arrival at court, on Whitsunday. It happened during supper after evening prayers.
[^22]: Among such belongs, for example, the theory of M. Baigent, R. Leigh, and H. Lincoln, contained in the work *Holy Blood, Holy Grail*, according to which Christ was not crucified at all, but with the help of Joseph of Arimathea(!) and his wife (!!!) Mary Magdalene, fled to Europe. The Grail is therefore actual "blood"—a line, a dynasty, whose secret was guarded by druids, Merovingians, Albigensians, Templars, Rosicrucians, Masons... only Jews and cyclists are missing. Forgive me, Jews are present—arguing that some Rex Mundi, a descendant and heir of Christ, is still waiting for the day when he will assume power over the world, the authors repeatedly quote *The Protocols of the Elders of Zion*. This theory was soundly ridiculed by Eco in *Foucault's Pendulum*.

It thundered, it brightened, and behold, before the eyes of the assembled company, a vessel covered with a veil appeared, carried by invisible hands. "The palace," we read, "was filled with the most beautiful fragrances in the world." And on the tables before the knights, exquisite meats appeared, and everyone had before him what he desired." And the Grail disappeared—as suddenly as it had appeared.
The initiator of the Great Quest is (in the Vulgate and in Malory) the least expected person—not Galahad, not Perceval, not Arthur, but... Gawain. It is Gawain who proposes to unravel the Great Mystery, to reveal what was hidden under the Veil. "Let each of us," Gawain calls, "take a knightly vow that tomorrow he will set out on an expedition that will last one year and one day..."

King Arthur is terrified—the Cistercians in the Vulgate clearly suggest that the king already knows: the end of an era is approaching. Götterdämmerung, the twilight of the gods, is drawing near. Those other gods. And other idols—other ideals, different from those established by the Lateran Councils. The ladies are also terrified—sinful and wicked daughters of Eve. They too know that it's the end of silks, the end of *amour courtois*; now there will be rosaries, prie-dieus, and hairshirts.
True, a few ladies also want to take vows and set out on the Quest, but the old hermit Nacien, present in Camelot, thunders with a great voice that it would be blasphemy and mortal sin for such vile creatures to seek the Grail. Male knights, if they are not without sin, can purify themselves through confession, but even confession will not help women. The daughters of Eve are impure and will remain impure forever. What have they to do with the Grail!
So the ladies stay, and the knights set out. The fellowship of the Round Table ceases to exist. Nothing matters. The threat to the country—evil giants and dragons, robber knights and bandits, Saxons, Irish, Picts—these are worldly and unworthy matters to trouble one's head with. The knights ride to seek the Grail. Each rides alone—they decide to separate. Each chooses his own path.

And before them all rides that one, the worthiest and purest—Galahad, invented specially for this purpose. And the reader already knows—among those paths chosen by the knights, the only one, the right one, the one leading to the goal—is Galahad's path.
Who is Galahad?
Joseph Campbell derives Galahad's name from the biblical Gilead. Gilead, according to Scripture, is admittedly not a person, but a fertile land in Transjordan—but it is a symbolic place, a testament to agreement and covenant (Genesis 31:47–52). Additionally, Campbell believes that the explanation of Galahad's name lies in the biblical sentence: "*Numquid resina non est in Galaad?*", meaning "Is there no balm in Gilead?" (Book of Jeremiah 8:22). The Arthurian Galahad was therefore, in the Vulgate Cycle, to be both a symbol of covenant and a balm, a remedy for ailments and all evil. A Paraclete. A comforter and savior.
55
Campbell also sees the inspiration for the Cistercians writing the Vulgate Cycle in the decisions made at the Fourth Lateran Council, convened by Innocent III in 1215. This Council, apart from the official call for a murderous crusade against the Albigensians and Waldensians, also defined the following dogma: during Holy Mass, at the elevation of the host and chalice, Christ is present. Really present. In body and blood. He is simultaneously priest and sacrifice: *In qua idem ipse sacerdos, et sacrificium Iesus Christus, cuius corpus et sanguis in sacramento altaris sub speciebus panis et vini veraciter continentur...*
And one more dogma was adopted at the Fourth Lateran Council. A dogma that exists to this day: There is only one faith and one Church. Only one. And only one, single right path, straying from which means eternal damnation. *Una vero est fidelium universalis ecclesia, extra quam nullus omnino salvatur...*
Only one path, Galahad's path. And only one Grail.

Thus, the Grail and Christ are one. To find the Grail after a long, dangerous, arduous journey—is to sail through life, avoiding the reefs of sin. Avoiding temptations, but not fearing suffering, to triumph in spirit over the weak body and sinful, transient worldly matter. To possess the Grail—is to achieve salvation. To climb Mount Montsalvat, to become *salvatur*. To complete the mystery. To cross the boundary.
Why did the monks invent Galahad? And why did they make him the son of Lancelot, who is, after all, the most sinful of sinners, because he constantly remains in a wicked relationship with Guinevere? Even when he conceives Galahad with Elaine, he thinks he is making love to the queen, another man's wife. Galahad is therefore the child of sin and transgression! Lancelot succumbs to lust, a mortal sin, and covets his neighbor's wife. To make matters worse, this neighbor is the king, his lord, his suzerain. Lancelot breaks one of the holiest commandments of a medieval knight—he commits treason against his suzerain. Why then does the Vulgate make Galahad the son of Lancelot, an adulterer and oath-breaker?

The son, the child, symbolizes rebirth, a new birth. Rebirth in a better, ideal form—in the form we could have had, if life had not tainted us. And more—the son is the redemption of sins. For the monks of the Vulgate, Galahad is not only a reincarnation—he is the redemption of Lancelot's sins. Lancelot, who once bore the name Galahad, before abandoning it for a secular and worldly *nom de guerre*. Galahad is what Lancelot could have been, if...
Lancelot, of course, does not find the Grail, though he searches intensively. He cannot, because... he is still the sinful Lancelot, not the pure Galahad. Gawain and Lionel also fail—because they remain proud, because they are still arrogant, because they are still occupied with matters of this world, not the ideals of the spirit. Because they are still ordinary, not ideal knights.
56
The Grail is finally found by three pure and sinless knights: Galahad, Perceval, and Bors. But Perceval and Bors—despite their purity (sexually understood), despite being righteous knights—can only be Galahad's companions in the Vulgate. Even Perceval, who in all earlier versions was the one who found the Grail, recedes into the background in the Vulgate. Why? Because there can be only one. There is only one path. Galahad, and no one else—this is a warning to all Albigensians of this world. *Una vero est fidelium universalis ecclesia!*

Galahad, having achieved the Supreme Goal, departs from this sinful vale of tears forever, along with the wondrous vessel. Perceval casts off his armor, becomes a hermit, and soon dies. Only Bors returns to Camelot, to communicate to Arthur the message of the Cistercians and the Vulgate: with the Grail, hope has departed. The symbol and center of the spirit have disappeared—and without spirit, the worldly realm, the world of knighthood, Arthur's world—these worlds must crumble into dust and ashes...

The Grail—like almost every element of the Arthurian legend—has its prototype in Celtic mythology. This is absolutely certain and repeatedly confirmed. Like every Celtic element of the legend, it underwent modifications intended to serve specific purposes. Each successive era added its own goals—modern goals, corresponding to the modern and current moral ideals of that era, or relatively, the ideals of the group that considered itself ideal. The religious version of the myth is older than the legend itself by over six hundred years. Can it be argued, however, that the religious version is therefore better and more moral than the Celtic proto-version, because in the times of the Vulgate's creation, culture and civilization had matured by six hundred years? Must modifying and modernizing a myth always mean enriching it, ennobling the ideas contained in the myth?

The ideals of Christianity, grafted onto the Arthurian legend at the initiative of Bernard of Clairvaux, are today considered lofty and noble—and the Christian Grail (invariably in the form of a chalice or cup) has taken an prominent place in contemporary culture as a symbol of a holy and supreme ideal. One cannot forget, however, that such an exegesis of the myth had a very specific purpose in the times of the Vulgate Cycle's creation—moral and political. Firstly, it was necessary to wage a merciless battle against the ideals of *amour courtois*, which clashed with the asceticism recommended by the Church and its programmatic idiosyncrasy towards all forms of worldly—and especially physical—love. *Amour courtois* was, in relation to the Church, what the Vendée later was to the French Revolution and Napoleon—rebellion and resistance. *Amour courtois* blasphemously suggested that love for a woman could guide a man as strongly as love for God. According to the canons of *amour courtois*, a knight performs knightly service to the lady of his heart, he is her liegeman—he treats the lady—a vessel of sin—on par with the king, suzerain, God's anointed. This is unthinkable!
57
Interestingly, of all versions of the legend, the Vulgate is the most direct and literal when it comes to matters of carnal love. The work simply seethes with sex and eroticism. Where Malory limits himself (when describing women) to the statement: "She was a very beautiful damsel," the Vulgate does not hesitate to inform that: "her shapely breasts, small, white, and firm, rose under her dress like hard little apples." Malory (speaking, for example, of Lancelot and Guinevere) delicately states: "Whether they were in bed together that night or not, I do not know and dare not say, for remember that in those days love had a different form than today." In similar situations in the Vulgate, a pair of lovers, "having lain down naked and embraced each other tightly," "amuse themselves splendidly together," "flatter each other beautifully," etc. Undoubtedly, this stems from the same source as the entire campaign against sex, launched by the Church—from the unsuppressible carnal desires burning in pious little brothers and sisters, stupefied by asceticism and celibacy.
Or perhaps the pious monks were aware that the goal they wanted to achieve required... attractive content? Or perhaps their message is as follows: if you must, it's better to "flatter each other beautifully" than to serve as a liegeman. Better to lie down naked for a short while and amuse oneself, instead of dying of love and, from afar, bestowing upon a woman reverence she is not worthy of...

The second goal of the ecclesiastical version was as follows: it was necessary to take knighthood and its ideals firmly in hand—or, lacking such, to create them. The knight was to stop thinking about mundane trifles—from the moment of his dubbing, which (in a later version, from the 11th century) had the character of a religious initiation, he was to wait in peace and pious concentration for the crowning of his life. He was to await the moment when the Grail would appear—in the form, for example, of a call to crusade.[^23]

It must be admitted that the Church acted cleverly—it did not cast anathema on the legend or thunder from the pulpit. Instead, it created and circulated its own version of the myth—strong enough and appealing enough to the public to supplant the previous ones. A religious version, in some aspects obligatory and classic to this day.
This classicism, however, is severely undermined by another version of the Quest for the Grail. Wolfram von Eschenbach's version. A version that must be considered rebellious—today we would say dissident. Wolfram von Eschenbach is also in the "Vendée," associating himself with Chrétien de Troyes and the trouvères—against Robert de Boron—and (later) the Cistercians.

In Wolfram's version, the Grail is... a stone. Not a bowl, not a goblet, not a cup, not a liturgical chalice, but a stone. True, not an ordinary one, but a wondrous
[^23]: The ideal, the model to be emulated—and the apotheosis—of knighthood and all Christian virtues is proclaimed by Bernard of Clairvaux to be the Order of the Templars, God's militia, ready to fight in defense of the faith at any call. This takes place in 1128. Less than two hundred years later, in 1307, the ideal knights, accused of witchcraft, sodomy, demonolatry, blasphemy, and heresy, scream in pain in torture chambers and burn at the stake throughout France.

one—the mere sight of this stone grants eternal youth; thanks to it, the rejuvenated phoenix rises from the ashes. But a stone (philosophical?) is not a chalice—a stone eliminates from the story its liturgical subtext and connections with the Eucharist. A stone is much closer to Kabbalah...[^24]
In Wolfram's version, there is no Galahad. There is no *chevalier sans peur et sans reproche*, who is born and becomes a knight solely for one purpose. There is only Parsifal—and Parsifal is not an ideal. Parsifal, however, desires to be one and strives for it.
Wolfram von Eschenbach, as I mentioned, was himself a brave knight, a triumphant victor in jousts. It is easier to understand his dissident approach to the religious version of the legend if we recall that the Church repeatedly tried to enforce a ban on tournaments. Knight Wolfram understood knightly ideals differently.

The romance of Wolfram, a brave knight, able to enjoy life, breathes with the joy of life and optimism. Parsifal, by obtaining the Grail, learns the essence and beauty of life. He learns the essence of humanism. Parsifal delves into the mystery so that he can heal Amfortas, the Fisher King, from his suffering. Parsifal does not depart from this world with the Grail; he remains, so that now, having achieved the highest spiritual value (which the Grail in Wolfram's work by no means ceases to be), he can enjoy life twofold.
Wolfram's message is: let us not wait for revelation and a command from above, let us not wait for any *Deus vult*. Let us seek the Grail within ourselves. Because the Grail—is nobility, it is love for one's neighbor, it is the ability to empathize. True knightly ideals, towards which it is worth and necessary to seek the right path, to break through the wild forest, where, I quote, "there is neither road nor path." Everyone must find their own path. But it is not true that there is only one path. There are many. Infinitely many.
[^24]: Wolfram von Eschenbach (following his predecessors) also refers to "secret sources." *Parzival* was supposedly based on information received from Guiot de Provins, a troubadour strongly associated with the Templars. Guiot, in turn, supposedly drew his information about the Grail from masters at the famous Kabbalist school in Toledo, especially from the Jewish astronomer and sage Flegetanis.
The dissident nature of Wolfram's work is also evident in another matter: the Grail is hidden on Mount Munsalvaesche, or Montsalvat. It is believed that Montsalvat is Montségur, the last stronghold of the Albigensians, whose capture and massacre in 1244 meant the end of heresy in Languedoc. This reference (as well as elements of mystical and convoluted symbolism in *Parzival*) is considered clear evidence of Wolfram's fascination with the Manichaean and Cathar schisms. Another fact that could confirm this: the guardians of the Grail on Mount Montsalvat are Templars, whom Pope Innocent III, even in Wolfram's time, sharply criticized for favoring the Cathars, not refraining from allusions to the "witchcraft" spreading in the order (bull *De insolentia Templariorum*). The years 1200–1220, in which Wolfram wrote *Parzival*, demanded careful avoidance of allusions to both Albigensians and Templars. Wolfram did not do this. I will not speculate why this happened, because I am afraid (like Baigent and Co.) of getting entangled in some conspiracy theory of history.
59
Parsifal sympathizes with the Fisher King. Parsifal is the Fool who knows one thing—the King suffers. This Fool, as you remember, is told about by one fool, Parry, to another fool, Jack Lucas, as they both lie on the grass in Central Park late at night, trying to disperse the clouds in the sky with the power of their will. And later, when one of these fools suffers, when he fades in a coma on a bed in a New York clinic, the other risks his life to obtain the Grail. A cup, on which is written: "To Lannie Carmichael, Christmas 1932." The inscription is not important. What is important is humanity. Heart.

Indeed, though I appreciate the intentions, I prefer the humanism of Wolfram von Eschenbach and Terry Gilliam to the idiosyncrasies of embittered Cistercian scribes and Bernard of Clairvaux...
Years passed, culture "matured" further, and the Arthurian myth developed, serving subsequent purposes. I will tell of one such purpose with the utmost reluctance, solely out of duty; to do so, indeed, I must "close my eyes and think of England." For it so happened that nearly eight hundred years after the creation of the Vulgate Cycle, Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler attempted to adapt the myth of Arthur and the Round Table to the ideology and code of his black knights of the SS. And Hitler (a historically confirmed fact, not repeated from the film about Indiana Jones's adventures) commissioned a special group to conduct searches for Mount Montsalvat and the Grail in the Pyrenees and Languedoc.[^25]

The wondrous vessel from the legend of King Arthur was to serve the brown-shirted heirs of the Nibelungs and the "Aryan" knightly tradition as a *Wunderwaffe* against "perfidious Albion"! The Grail was to be used as a weapon against the Celts...
The Celts, who invented the Grail.

The source, prototype, and archetype of the Grail—though for adherents of the canonical version of the legend this will sound like sacrilege—are obviously legendary Celtic artifacts. In most cases—cauldrons.
A wondrous cauldron, usually the property of some god or group of gods, appears very frequently in Celtic tales. The Irish god Dagda, one of the sons of the goddess Danu, possessed a cauldron called Undry. Every one of Dagda's guests found in the cauldron food appropriate to their own merits and deeds. Righteous heroes and the bravest warriors fished out the tastiest, best morsels from the cauldron. No one left Undry hungry. Everyone found in the cauldron—I recall here the text of the Vulgate—
[^25]: The searches and excavations in southern France were sponsored by Alfred Rosenberg himself, the chief specialist in matters of racial purity. It is interesting how Herr Rosenberg's racial theories fitted with the fact that, according to Wolfram von Eschenbach, both "German" (*echt Deutsch*) knights of the Grail, Parsifal and Lohengrin, being close relatives of the Fisher King Amfortas, were directly descended from Joseph of Arimathea, which meant that, according to Nazi standards, they had Jewish blood in their veins.

"exquisite meats, and everyone had before him what he desired." Are further examples needed? With pleasure:
The hero Cuchulainn, during a heroic expedition to Dún Scaith, the City of Shadows, obtained from the gods of Darkness a wondrous cauldron in which meat could never run out.
And in Brythonic and Welsh mythology? The god Brân possessed a cauldron which—identically to the later Grail—regenerated vital forces, healed, and even restored life to the dead.
The goddess Ceridwen had a magic cauldron in which she brewed an elixir of wisdom and knowledge. The elixir was intended for the goddess's son, but by chance, Ceridwen's young servant, a boy named Gwion Bach, tasted it. The magic potion worked—when the boy grew up, he became famous as Taliesin, the greatest bard of Britain...
The god Pwyll, ruler of the land of Annwvyn, possessed a cauldron that not only brewed food—it was a pearl-encrusted Cauldron of Inspiration and Poetry, and thus of things that had enormous spiritual value for the Celts. Neither coward, nor traitor, nor perjurer, nor liar could even approach Pwyll's cauldron... Does this not remind you of anything? It is the Grail, a spitting image!

In Welsh legend, Pwyll's cauldron was hidden in the inaccessible, constantly revolving castle of Caer Sidi—an obvious prototype of the Fisher King's castle and Mount Montsalvat. Many heroes tried to obtain it, but in Welsh legend, none other than the hero among heroes, the bravest and worthiest of all Celts among Celts—King Arthur himself, aided by the bard Taliesin—accomplished this...
As we already know, the first continental discoverer of the Grail was Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval. Perceval, in turn, is derived from the mythical Welsh hero Peredur. And Peredur in Welsh myths, as a result of long searches and wanderings, found a wondrous and mysterious object, which was... a severed, blood-dripping head on a platter, carried by two virgins. Myth researchers identify this macabre object with the head of the god Brân the Blessed (vide Welsh mythology), which became an oracle and warned the Britons against enemy invasions. Researchers not only see in this head one of the prototypes of the Grail—it is believed that ancient Celts had a custom of mummifying, and then worshipping, severed heads and skulls—both of enemies and respected ancestors. The name of the fearsome god Cromm Cruach, worshipped in Ireland, is translated as Bloody Head. Thus, the culmination of Peredur's journey is the finding of a "holy" artifact. Peredur is a witness to a mystery...
Except that it is a Celtic mystery. Which, over time, was "reinterpreted" and appropriately embellished. Read—falsified.

There is also another legend, obviously connected with the Quest for the Grail. It is the famous and popular tale in Welsh mythology, repeated
61
in one of the branches of the *Mabinogion*, about the love of the hero Culhwch for Olwen, a maiden so beautiful that wherever she stepped, four white clovers grew (hence her name, meaning White Track).
Unfortunately, Olwen was the daughter of the giant cyclops Ysbaddaden Pencawr, and according to prophecy, the day she took a husband was to mean the last day of her father's life. No wonder, then, that Ysbaddaden looked unfavorably upon candidates for sons-in-law—he treated each one immediately with a blow of a club to the head. Olwen thus remained a maiden, and Ysbaddaden enjoyed good health and intended to live long.
Culhwch, aware that he himself could not achieve much here, turned for help to King Arthur and his company. Soon, a whole crowd of "suitors" armed to the teeth appeared at Ysbaddaden Pencawr's castle. Seeing what was happening, Ysbaddaden resorted to a ruse. He set conditions. "Alright," he said, "fine, Olwen will marry Culhwch, but first, pile up the wedding gifts here." And he began to list these gifts...
The list was long and breathtaking—the giant demanded for his daughter the performance of a series of labors worthy of Heracles, as well as the delivery of an incredible number of magical objects and artifacts, the acquisition of even one of which would constitute a feat requiring superhuman effort from a whole group of heroes. But a group of heroes was, after all, at his beck and call...

A long and arduous quest began—the Search. It was necessary to fight giants, monsters, even gods. Fortunately, other gods helped. Soon Ysbaddaden had almost everything he had demanded—including (note!) the wondrous Cauldron of Diwrnach, the only vessel capable of brewing food for the wedding feast. Arthur's knights obtained everything—only three magical objects were missing—a razor, scissors, and a comb—hidden in the head of a macabre beast—a giant boar, Twrch Trwyth.
Arthur's entire company divided into groups, and each group set off in a different direction of the world. For to defeat the boar, further magical objects were necessary. Long, long did the knights wander and had countless adventures, but finally, they completed everything. Now they could tackle the boar—but it was unknown where this boar was. To track it down, the knights again divided and rode off in all directions of the world...
The boar was tracked down and cornered in Ireland. Arthur himself fought with it for nine days and nine nights, but could not overcome it. And Twrch Trwyth, angered beyond measure, swam to Wales, to wreak havoc there, in the native land of hunters, as much as he could.
They chased each other back and forth across the whole of Wales for a long time (the legend is terrifyingly precise, but also devilishly long). Many a good knight fell to the terrible boar's tusks, but finally Arthur, the god Manawydan ap Llyr, and several other daredevils subdued the boar in the currents of the river Hafren (today Severn).
62
They forcibly tore the razor and scissors from the beast's head. Before they could take the comb, however, Twrch Trwyth broke free and fled to Cornwall...
The dangers (and length of description) of the chase through Cornwall pale in comparison to the entire preceding part of the legend. So, to cut it short: the boar was finally caught and the comb taken from him, and Twrch Trwyth leaped into the sea waves and was never heard from again.
Arthur and the surviving knights returned to Ysbaddaden and showed him their spoils. Before the giant could marvel, they cut off his head, and Culhwch married the beautiful Olwen before his father-in-law cooled.

And what is the moral of this?
Hmm... I wouldn't want to advance the theory that the primordial prototype of the Grail quest was a hunt for a great wild sow. I don't want to be that trivial. I prefer—following Parnicki and Dante—to identify the Grail with the
